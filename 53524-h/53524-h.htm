The reader and observer is
constantly reminded that
“there is nothing new under
the sun.” We no sooner
find some rare gem of
thought or expression than
we discover that it is only
an old diamond, polished anew, perhaps,
and offered as an original stone. Neither
the reader nor the writer is always aware
that the gem is antique and the setting alone
is new.</p>

<p class='c000'>The rich mine where the treasure was first
found was exhausted in a few brief years,
and then became like all the dust of all the
worlds; but the gem polished and worn
by time and use, ever sparkles and shines,
regardless of the fact that the miner’s name
is forgotten and his work alone remains.
Thus Nature, the great communist, provides
that the treasures of genius, like her
own bountiful gifts of sunlight, rain and
air, shall remain the common property of
all her children while any dwell upon the
earth.</p>

<p class='c000'>Current literature seems to point to the
ascendancy of what is often termed the
“pessimistic school.” In one sense this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>philosophy uncrowns man and places him
in his proper relation to the great universe,
of which he is so small a part; but while it
makes less of man, it expects less from him,
and covers his deeds with that cloak of
charity, which is the legitimate garment of
the great Unknown. But these modern reflections
on life and its problems, its purposes
and lessons, are far from new. Without
venturing a guess as to their origin or
age, we take up that old Persian Pearl,—the
“Rubaiyat,” and find on its musty pages
the great thoughts and searching questions,
which have ever returned to man since the
intellect was born, and which will still remain
unanswered when the last word shall
have been spoken, and the race have run its
course.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is nearly eight hundred years since
Omar Khayyam, the Persian astronomer, philosopher,
and poet, mused and wrote upon
the uncertainty of life, the eternity of time
and the mutability of human things. Since
the rose bush was planted above his grave,
the material world has been almost made
anew. Art and literature have given countless
treasures to the earth, and science has
solved its mysteries without end. But the
riddles of existence—the problems of life,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>the deep heart of the universe, the cause and
purpose and end of all, are mysteries as dark
and inscrutable as they were eight centuries
ago. To quote from the Rubaiyat:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>There was the Door to which I found no Key;</div>
      <div class='line'>There was the Veil thro’ which I could not see:</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Some little talk awhile of Me and Thee</div>
      <div class='line'>There was—and then no more of Thee and Me.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>As Egypt is the newest country visited
by the traveler, so this old book, burnished
by the genius of FitzGerald, comes to us as
the latest and profoundest word upon the
infinite mysteries which over-shadow human
life. It seems to be the last word, rather
than one of the first, spoken to the perplexed
soul of man, calling him from the
vain pursuit of vanities, and asking what all
of it is about.</p>

<p class='c000'>To an egoistic, boasting age and nation,
this message, coming from a far off time
and a distant land, reminds us that all wisdom
is garnered neither now nor here. This
Persian Pearl remained unpolished for more
than seven hundred years. It was left for
Edward FitzGerald carefully and patiently
to burnish up the gem, and make it the thing
of beauty that we know.</p>

<p class='c000'>It may be that research and study would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>reveal much of the personal traits and private
life of the great Persian philosopher,
whose fame has so outlived his clay, but with
these we can have no concern. It is not
important to know his parents, or whether
he had a wife or children, or cattle or lands.
All of these are gone and only his work remains.
True, we cannot but reflect on the
personality of the poet in whose brain these
great thoughts were born, but we can know
the man only by knowing his works. Some
there are who stand at a distance and view
the acts of the imperfect beings, who at the
best stumble and grope along the uncertain
path between the cradle and the grave. All
the footsteps that are straight and true are
unnoticed as they pass by, but the irregular,
uncertain, shifting tracks stand out alone to
mark the character of the pilgrim, who
bore his heavy load the best he could.
These forget that every son of man travels
an unbeaten path—a road beset with dangers
and temptations that no other wanderer
met; that his footsteps can be judged only
in the full knowledge of the strength and
light he had, the burden that he carried, the
obstacles and temptations that he met, and
a thorough knowledge of every open and secret
motive that impelled him here or there.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>That Omar’s steps were often winding
and devious, and like those of all other
mortal men, we gather from his words. No
doubt his neighbors delighted in gossiping
about the great philosopher, and his reputation
was often tarnished by their idle words.
These slanderers have been long forgotten—they
could not live upon the great name
they sullied, and we should not even know
he was their prey except for lines like these:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Indeed the Idols I have loved so long</div>
      <div class='line'>Have done my credit in Men’s eyes much wrong;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Have drown’d my Glory in a shallow Cup,</div>
      <div class='line'>And sold my reputation for a Song.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Eight hundred years ago, as to-day, the
love of wine was one of the chief weaknesses
of the flesh. Doubtless the other
frailties of human nature are of substantially
the same kind as eight centuries ago, for
while man may change the fashion of his
garment or religion, nature is ever consistent
and persistent, and is the same yesterday,
to-day and forever. But our old human
philosopher, like our modern human men,
saw the folly of his ways, and made many a
brave resolve, but these good intentions and
solemn purposes melted in the sunshine then
the same as now.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>Indeed, indeed, Repentance oft before</div>
      <div class='line'>I swore—but was I sober when I swore?</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And then and then came Spring, and Rose-in-hand</div>
      <div class='line'>My thread-bare Penitence apieces tore.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>But Omar was greater than most of the
weak and sinning children of to-day. His
own frailties taught him the rare lesson, that
of all the virtues, charity is the chiefest!
And as we read the wondrous product of
his brain and understand the thoughts that
stirred his being, we can know the man better
than his neighbors who judged a great
soul by the narrow vision of sordid minds.
We know that his purpose was lofty, and
above all the mists and conflicting emotions
and desires of his life he rose majestic and
supreme, unsullied by the specks that can
only mar the weak. Let us turn then to the
philosophy and poetry of this great soul to
know the man, and as figs are not gathered
of thistles, we may be sure that broad
thoughts, high aspirations, and tender charity
are born only of great minds and rare
men.</p>

<p class='c000'>To Omar Khayyam, the so-called sins of
men were not crimes, but weaknesses inherent
in their being and beyond their power
to prevent or overcome. He knew that man
could not separate himself from all the rest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>of nature; and that the rules and conditions
of his being were as fixed and absolute as
the revolutions of the planets and the changing
seasons of the year. Above man and
his works he saw the heavy hand of destiny,
ever guiding and controlling, ever moving
its creature forward to the inevitable fate
that all the centuries had placed in store for
the helpless captive, marching shackled to
the block.</p>

<p class='c000'>There have ever been two views of life.
Both philosophies have been made by man
and mostly for him. One places him above
all the rest of the universe, whose infinite
mysteries are constantly revolving and
changing before his hazy, wondering gaze.
The portion of the world that comes nearest
to his eyes he cannot understand, and his
own existence is a riddle that all the ages
have not solved. And yet, amidst it all, one
system teaches that man rules supreme,—and
the fate of all the worlds, or of all that
may exist thereon, has no relation to his
own. The other peers into the thick darkness
that hangs above, and can see no light,
it does not understand and will not guess;
the endless mysteries are not for mortal
man to solve. Its devotees feel themselves
part of a mighty whole, and are powerless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>to separate their lives from all the rest, and
would not dare to undertake it if they could.
They know that in the great, unlimited universe
they are less than the tiniest bubble in
the wildest, angriest sea. That in the words
of the Rubaiyat:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>We are no other than a moving row</div>
      <div class='line'>Of magic Shadow-shapes that come and go</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Round with this Sun-illumined Lantern held</div>
      <div class='line'>In Midnight by the Master of the Show.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Omar Khayyam was probably not the first,
certainly not the last, to feel the impotence
of man in the great power which animates
the whole. He could have no faith in the
cruel religious tenets, which eight centuries
ago in Persia, as ever since in the Christian
world, have taught the responsibility of the
helpless victim for the great, blind work in
which he had no part. He seemed to think
that back of all the universe, some intelligent
power moved and controlled the world
for some purpose unknown to all except
himself, but he could not think that man
was in any way accountable for the whole.
To him, the great master sent us here or
there to suit his will, and it was left for us
only to obey his mighty power. The individual
units of humanity were to him only:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Impotent Pieces of the Game He plays</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon this checker-board of Nights and Days;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Hither and thither moves, and checks, and slays,</div>
      <div class='line'>And one by one back in the Closet lays.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Even this does not sufficiently express his
thought of man’s absolute irresponsibility
for his acts.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have all met the parallel drawn between
man and the pottery fashioned by the
moulder from the clay. Perhaps there is no
better illustration of the helplessness of the
human being in the hands of the power that
fashioned and shaped him, even ages before
his birth,—the uncontrollable force that determined
the length of his body, the color
of his hair, the size and shape of his brain
and the contour of his face. But the comparison
made in the beautiful stanza wrought
by Omar, and retouched and gilded by the
magic of FitzGerald, is wondrously powerful
and fine. The poet ranges his poor
pieces of pottery in line, each representing
a man; each imperfect in structure or form,
like all the other creatures ever made.
These poor, imperfect vessels, fresh from
the potter, each pleads its cause and makes
excuses for its faults.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>After a momentary silence spake</div>
      <div class='line'>Some vessel of a more ungainly Make:</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“They sneer at me for leaning all awry:</div>
      <div class='line'>What! did the Hand then of the Potter shake?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>When will humanity be great enough and
good enough to distinguish between the
fault of the potter and the fault of the pot!
When can it look over the myriads of human
beings, each with his flaws and limitations,
and pity instead of blame!</p>

<p class='c000'>The history of the past is a record of
man’s cruel inhumanity to man; of one imperfect
vessel accusing and shattering another
for the faults of both. In ancient
times and amongst savage tribes, the old, the
infirm, and the diseased were led out and
put to death; even later, the maniac and
imbecile were fettered, chained, beaten, and
imprisoned because they were different
from other men. The world has grown a
little wiser, and perhaps humaner, as the
centuries have passed away. We have
learned to build asylums, and treat the afflicted
with tenderness and care. We have
learned not to blame the dwarf for his stature;
the hunchback for his load; the deaf
because they cannot hear, and the blind because
they cannot see. We do not expect
the midget to carry the giant’s load, or the
cripple to triumph in a contest of speed.
We establish a regulation size for policemen
and soldiers, but we do not put a man to
death because his stature is below the standard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>fixed. We forgive the size of the foot,
the length of the arm, the shade of the hair,
the color of the eye, and even the form of
the skull. But, while we do not blame a
man because he has an ill-shaped head, we
punish him because the brain within conforms
to the bone which molds its form.
The world has made guns and swords, racks
and dungeons, chains and whips, blocks and
gibbets, and to these have dragged an endless
procession thro’ all the past. It has
penned and maimed, tortured and killed,
because the potter’s work was imperfect and
the clay was weak. During all the ages it
has punished mental deformity as a crime,
and without pity or regret has crushed the
imperfect vessels beneath its feet. Every
jail, every scaffold, every victim—is a monument
to its cruelty and blind unreasoning
wrath. Whether it was a fire kindled to
burn a heretic in Geneva,—a gibbet erected
to kill a witch in Salem,—or a scaffold made
to put to death an ordinary “criminal,” it
has ever been the same,—the punishment of
the creature for the creator’s fault. There
might be some excuse if man could turn
from the frail, cracked vessels, and bring to
trial the great potter for the imperfect work
of his hand.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>But we live in the shadows; we can see
only the causes and effects that are the closest
to our eyes. If the clouds would rise,
and the sun shine bright, and our vision
reach out into time and space, we might
find that these cracked vessels serve as high
a purpose in a great, broad scheme, as the
finest clay, wrought in the most beautiful
and perfect form. The following stanza
was born of this philosophy and would inevitably
come from the broad, charitable
brain that had studied the creeds that told
of the cruelty of the great Maker, but
whose brain and conscience had not been
stunted and warped by their palsying dogmas:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Then said a Second—“Ne’er a peevish Boy</div>
      <div class='line'>Would break the Bowl from which he drank in joy;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And he that with his hand the Vessel made</div>
      <div class='line'>Will surely not in after Wrath destroy.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The cruel religious dogmas, which in
Omar’s land and Age, as in our own, blackened
both man and his Maker, had no terrors
for a soul like his. He could not believe
in eternal punishment. The doctrine
was a slander, alike to God and man. He
felt something of the greatness of a force
that could permeate and move the countless
worlds, which make up the limitless, unfathomed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>infinite we call the Universe. He saw
in man one of the smallest and most insignificant
toys created by this power to serve
some unknown end; and he could not believe
that the Master-Builder would demand
of his imperfect children more than he had
furnished them the strength to give. His
faith in the justice of man’s case before the
great Judge is shown in the following
stanza:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Oh Thou, who didst with pitfall and with gin</div>
      <div class='line'>Beset the Road I was to wander in,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thou wilt not with Predestin’d Evil round</div>
      <div class='line'>Enmesh, and then impute my Fall to Sin!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>But even more strongly he presents the
case of God against man, and man against
God, for all the crimes and miseries and
sufferings of the world. It would doubtless
be difficult in all the literature of the earth
to find a juster, bolder statement of the old
question of the responsibility for sin. To
some minds, this strong expression may
seem like blasphemy, but it is manly and
courageous, logical and just.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Oh, Thou, who Man of baser Earth didst make</div>
      <div class='line'>And ev’n with Paradise devise the Snake;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>For all the Sin wherewith the face of Man</div>
      <div class='line'>Is blacken’d—Man’s forgiveness give—and take!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>This is not the cringing prayer of the
coward, who asks God’s forgiveness to appease
his wrath, but the utterance of a noble
soul, who asks forgiveness for the shortcomings
of his life, and at the same time pardons
his Maker for creating him as he did.
The world has heard much of man’s duty
to God, of the responsibility which the unconsulted,
fragile children of a day owe to
the power that is responsible for all. It is
time we heard more of the duty of God to
man; the responsibility of the Creator for
making “conscious something” out of unthinking,
unfeeling clay.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>“Oh, many a cup of this forbidden Wine</div>
      <div class='line'>Must drown the memory of that insolence!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The world has talked the same nonsense
of the duty of children to parents. It has
taught this, because parents are larger, and
have the brute power to compel obedience
to their demands. All the duties are from
parents to children,—from those who
thoughtlessly, wantonly, to satisfy their own
desires, call into conscious being a human
life,—send another soul with all its responsibilities
out on the great, wide sea, to be
tossed and buffeted and torn, until, mangled
and dead, it is thrown out upon the sands to
bleach.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>But after all, whether it was wise or unwise,
just or unjust, we have been placed
upon the earth as sentient beings and
charged with the responsibilities of life; and
practical philosophy asks the question, what
does it mean, and how shall we take the
journey which a higher power has decreed
that we shall make?</p>

<p class='c000'>The poet and the dreamer and the copy
book have told us much of the meaning of
life. We often repeat these lessons to make
ourselves believe them true. When we feel
a doubt casting its shadow across our path,
we read them once again to drive the doubt
away; and yet, in spite of all, we know absolutely
nothing of the scheme, or whether
there is any kind of plan. We are only
whistlers passing through a graveyard, with
our ears tied close and our eyes shut fast. It
would surely be as well to step boldly up
and read the inscription on the marble tomb
and then walk round and look at the vacant,
grinning space upon the other side, calmly
waiting to record our name.</p>

<p class='c000'>Measured by the philosophy of to-day,
Omar Khayyam was a pessimist; he was not
gifted with second sight. He saw no spooks
and ghosts, and he would not look out into
the midnight, and declare that his eyes discerned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>a glorious rainbow, bright with fresh
colors and unbounded hopes. All the proud
promises and brave assumptions and false
theories of the world were to him a mockery
and a sham. The mysticisms of religion
and philosophy alike were hollow and bare.
The “jarring sects” and quibbling doctors,
with their fine-spun webs, were worthy the
attention only of children and professors.
This is the way he put them down:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Myself when young did eagerly frequent</div>
      <div class='line'>Doctor and Saint, and heard great argument</div>
      <div class='line in2'>About it and about; but evermore</div>
      <div class='line'>Came out by the same door wherein I went.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>While it is true that in the common meaning
Omar was a pessimist, still this word,
like many others, is rarely well defined. All
men understand the uncertainties of life,
the disappointments and troubles of existence,
and the infinitesimal time that is reluctantly
parceled out to each mortal from
the eternity that had no beginning and will
have no end. The pessimist looks at all the
hurry and rush, the torment and strife, the
ambitions and disappointments that are the
common lot, and can see no prizes so tempting
as rest and peace. He makes the most
of what he has, and looks contentedly forward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>to the long sleep that brings relief at
last.</p>

<p class='c000'>Omar Khayyam was not deceived by all
the glitter and bustle of the world. He saw
the stage from behind the curtain, as well as
from the circle before the scenes. He
looked on the great surging mass of men,
ever pulling and pushing, striving and trying,
working and fighting, as if all eternity
was theirs in which to build, and all unmindful
of the silent bookkeeper, who
could be deceived by no false entries, and
ever remembered to demand his dues. Of
life he said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Tis but a Tent where takes his one day’s rest</div>
      <div class='line'>A Sultan to the Realm of Death addrest;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The Sultan rises, and the dark Ferrash</div>
      <div class='line'>Strikes, and prepares it for another Guest.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In the presence of all that the world had
to offer,—while honors and glories fell fast
upon his head, he still could not close his
eyes to the facts of existence, and the mortality
of human things. It may be that he
mused too much upon the great fact that
ever sternly faces life,—the great being before
whom all monarchs bow, and in whose
presence all crowns are shattered. To the
boasting and forgetful, these words may not
be pleasant, but they still are true:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>Why, all the Saints and Sages who discuss’d</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the Two worlds so learnedly are thrust</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Like foolish Prophets forth; their words to Scorn</div>
      <div class='line'>Are scatter’d and their Mouths are stopt with Dust.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Neither the great nor the good could
avoid the common fate; the unyielding
messenger came alike to call the proud Sultan
and the good and kindly friend.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>For some we loved, the loveliest and the best</div>
      <div class='line'>That from his Vintage rolling Time has prest,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Have drunk their Cup a Round or two before,</div>
      <div class='line'>And one by one crept silently to rest.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Death is so common that we sometimes
wonder why men make plans,—why they
ever toil or spin. But, of course, we can see
only the leaves that fall from other stalks.
Rarely do we feel that all this has a personal
meaning, and that our turn soon must come.
Omar looked at the stricken friends around
him, and thus mused:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Whether at Naishapur or Babylon,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whether the Cup with sweet or bitter run,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The Wine of Life keeps oozing drop by drop,</div>
      <div class='line'>The leaves of Life keep falling one by one.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It has never required the great or the
learned to note the constant falling of the
leaves and the ceaseless running of the sands.
It is mainly from this that systems of religion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>have been evolved. Man has ever sought
to make himself believe that these things
are not what they seem; that, in reality,
death is only birth, and the body but a prison
for the soul. This may be true, but the
constant cries and pleadings of the ages have
brought back no answering sound to prove
that death is anything but death.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our old philosopher could not accept
these pleasing creeds on faith. He preferred
to plant his feet upon the shifting
doubtful sands, rather than deceive himself
by alluring and delusive hopes. Upon the
old question of immortality, he could answer
only what he knew, and this is what he
said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Strange, is it not? that of the myriads who</div>
      <div class='line'>Before us pass’d the door of Darkness through</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Not one returns to tell us of the Road</div>
      <div class='line'>Which to discover we must travel too.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>This stanza is perhaps gloomy and hopeless,
but it is thoughtful, and brave, and
beautiful. We may seek to be children if
we will, but whatever our desires, we cannot
strangle the questions that ever rise before
our minds and will not be put away.
To our own souls we should be just and
true. Peace and comfort, when gained at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>the sacrifice of courage and integrity, are
purchased at too high a price. The truth
alone can make us free, and</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“One flash of it within the tavern caught</div>
      <div class='line'>Better than in the Temple lost outright.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Yes, one flash of the true light is better than
all the creeds and dogmas. It is better, even
though these hold out the fairest prospects
and the brightest dreams, and the flash of
true light is only the blackest midnight.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not only would Omar take away the hope
of Heaven, but he leaves us with little to
boast while we live upon the earth. Our
short, obscure existence is not felt or noticed
in the great sweep of time and the resistless
movement of the years. Along the pathway
of the world we leave scarce a footprint,
and our loudest voice and bravest words are
as completely lost as if spoken in the presence
of Niagara’s roar.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And fear not lest Existence closing your</div>
      <div class='line'>Account and mine, should know the like no more;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The Eternal Saki from that Bowl has pour’d</div>
      <div class='line'>Millions of Bubbles like us, and will pour.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The weakness and littleness of man has
been the subject of endless words before
and since, but never has poet put it more
strongly than here. The Eternal Saki—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>great wine pourer, tips his pitcher and turns
out millions of bubbles, and still they come
forever, and each of us is one.</p>

<p class='c000'>But however brave and stoical Omar
seems to be, still he feels sad when witnessing
the flight of years and the ravages of
time. It is, of course, useless to fight the
inevitable, and the strongest will must bend
and break before the weakening touch of
age. Whether it is good or bad, all cling
to existence, and sadly and reluctantly let go
the tendrils that hold to pulsing life. The
fading of Spring and youth, and the coming
of Autumn with its suggestions of the approaching
end, is most beautiful and touching
in this marvelous book:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Yet, Ah, that Spring should vanish with the Rose!</div>
      <div class='line'>That Youth’s sweet-scented manuscript should close!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The Nightingale that in the branches sang,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ah whence, and whither flown again, who knows!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>This strain of sadness is sincere and true.
To recognize the inevitable and not pretend
to deceive one’s self is one thing, but to
think that all is just and wise and best may
be quite another. Omar felt that fate was
inexorable, relentless and hard.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The moving Finger writes; and having writ,</div>
      <div class='line'>Moves on; nor all your piety nor Wit</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Shall lure it back to cancel half a line,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>He would have tempered her hardness
with a little human love and tender pity,
and bade the great Recorder leave much
untold. He recognized the fact that the
scheme could not be changed, and that even
our brief existence depended upon our subservience
to the great will that would neither
break nor bend; but he still regretted that
it was not better and kinder and more forgiving
than it is. There is almost a wail in
the strain of sadness in which he laments
the rigor of unyielding fate.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Would that some winged Angel ere too late</div>
      <div class='line'>Arrest the yet unfolded Roll of fate,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And make the stern Recorder otherwise</div>
      <div class='line'>Enregister, or quite obliterate!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Ah Love! could you and I with him conspire</div>
      <div class='line'>To grasp this sorry Scheme of Things entire,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Would we not shatter it to bits—and then</div>
      <div class='line'>Re-mould it nearer to the Heart’s Desire?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It is impossible to live to a moderate age
without forming some idea of the conduct
of life; this may be practical or theoretical,
or both. But either with or without consciousness
we construct some plan of life
and its purpose, and our daily conduct conforms
more or less closely to the theory that
we accept. The religionist teaches that the
hope of future rewards and punishments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>must be kept before the mind, or man would
give himself completely to indulgence, and
the race would die. This theory loses sight
of the fact that Nature herself is constantly
wiping out those who defy her laws, and
preserving longest those who conform to
the conditions she has imposed. Excesses
of all kinds destroy and weaken existence,
and bring the natural penalty, which leaves
only the more rational and temperate to perpetuate
life upon the earth. Of course
these observations apply, not to the fashions
and forms and conventions of man, except
so far as these conform to the unbending
laws of nature, which must ever be supreme.</p>

<p class='c000'>From Omar Khayyam’s views of life, he
could not but think that it was the duty of
every pilgrim to get the most he could in
his journey through the world. But, really,
all accept this obvious fact. The Religionist
says merely that man should be less
happy here,—that his enjoyment may be the
greater in the world to come. It is not in
the theory as to life’s purpose that men have
differed, but as to the conduct that really
brings the greatest happiness when the last
balance has been struck, and the book is
forever closed. Our poet could not see the
days and years go by and life’s sands swiftly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>running out, and still postpone all enjoyment
to some far off, misty time. He believed
in the reality of to-day, and that beyond
the present all was but a vision and a
dream. In his day, as in ours, the priests
held out the hope of heaven and fear of
hell, to keep the wanderer in the narrow
path. But Omar was a philosopher and astronomer.
He peered into the infinite
depths of endless space, and could see only
moving, whirling worlds like ours, and could
find no place for heaven or hell. What
the mysteries of astronomy could not reveal,
the theories of life left equally in the
dark. While he refused to be moved by a
literal heaven and hell, he yet felt a deep
meaning attached to these old religious
views. The humane, progressive thinkers
of to-day have scarcely gone beyond this old
seer, who lived eight centuries ago and pondered
the same problems over which our
theologians wrangle now. The following
stanza gives an interpretation of these religious
dogmas, which for beauty and breadth
and insight seems to be the latest product of
ethical, religious thought, instead of the
musty musings of an old pagan, who has
been dust almost eight hundred years:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I sent my Soul through the Invisible,</div>
      <div class='line'>Some letter of that After-Life to spell;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And by and by my Soul returned to me,</div>
      <div class='line'>And answer’d “I Myself am Heav’n and Hell.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>If these places are but states of consciousness,
it of course must follow that we make
our own heaven and hell, and it is, therefore,
the right and duty of each, not to wait
for some dreamy mirage born of old superstition,
unmanly fear, and unfounded faith,
but to take the present, fleeting moment,
and with it do the best we can. This stanza
may seem painfully sad and hopeless, but it
contains the true philosophy of life:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Ah, make the most of what we yet may spend,</div>
      <div class='line'>Before we too into the Dust descend;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Dust unto Dust, and under Dust, to lie,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sans Wine, sans Song, sans Singer, and—sans End!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Not only is the present the all important
time, but the realities know nothing except
the present. There is no moment but the
one that’s here,—the past is gone, the next
one has not come, and he that misses the
present loses all there is.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Some for the Glories of This World, and some</div>
      <div class='line'>Sigh for the Prophet’s paradise to come;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Ah, take the Cash, and let the Credit go,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor heed the rumble of a distant Drum!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>As to how the pleasures of life are to be
found, men never have agreed and never
can. Our view of pleasure, like our feelings
and emotions, grows from the condition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>of our being, and is the result of causes
that we did not create and cannot control.
Some there are who look at all the strife and
suffering of the world, and feel no kinship
to the great, surging mass that moves and
feels and thinks. These walk silently along
the path alone, oblivious alike to the pleasures
and the sufferings of the world around.
Others there are whose souls are so sensitive
that they feel the joys and sorrows of
the world, and who cannot separate their
lives from all the sentient, moving things
that teem and swarm upon the earth. Both
can and must feel those appetites and desires
that are ever incident to being. Without
these, nature could neither bring life upon
the earth nor sustain it when it came. It is
in the balancing of these feelings that nature
almost necessarily makes the imperfect man.
Unless the emotions and desires are sufficiently
developed, the creature is cold, impassive,
pulseless clay. If too much developed,
it runs the risk of sacrificing the
higher emotions and more lasting enjoyments
to the fleeting, sensual pleasures of
the hour. Almost every person must stand
upon one side or the other of this shadowy
line, which no man can see, and which he
would have no power to cross, even if he
knew where it ran.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>Perhaps the Rubaiyat shows too much
leaning toward the sensual; too great fondness
for the vine. Some of the allusions
were perhaps symbolical, but still, Omar
doubtless was very fond of wine and found
in its use one of the chief purposes of life.
Philosophy and theology could not satisfy
his mind. These furnished only visionary,
inconsistent theories of existence, utterly
barren and futile,—wholly purposeless and
wrong. After studying and wrangling and
disputing, he threw them to the winds and
reached out for the realities,—however
transitory and unsatisfactory these realities
seemed to be. His exchange of theories
and mysticisms for wine may be symbolical
or not, but whether literal or figurative, he
could hardly be cheated by the trade. This
is the way he relates the story of his change
of heart:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>You know, My Friends, with what a brave Carouse</div>
      <div class='line'>I made a Second Marriage in my house;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Divorced old barren Reason from my Bed,</div>
      <div class='line'>And took the Daughter of the Vine to spouse.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>After throwing the theoretical philosophy
to the winds, he turned to the vine to learn
what life really meant. No doubt, the vessel
here is figuratively used. It might mean
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>a wine cup, it might mean feeding a beggar,
it might mean a warm room and comfortable
dress. It meant something besides
the intangible, barren theories, which have
ever furnished theologians and professors
with the pleasing occupation of splitting
hairs and quibbling about the meaning of
terms.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Then to the Lip of this poor earthen Urn</div>
      <div class='line'>I lean’d, the secret of my Life to learn;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And Lip to Lip it murmur’d—“While you live,</div>
      <div class='line'>Drink!—for, once dead, you never shall return.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Neither would it do to postpone the pleasures
of the wine,—time is fleeting, and
every hour may be the last. Life has no
space for resolutions or regrets. These
only rob existence of a portion of the poor
prizes that she stingily scatters into the ring
to be fought and scrambled after by the
crowd.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Come, fill the Cup, and in the fire of Spring</div>
      <div class='line'>Your Winter-garment of Repentance fling;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The Bird of Time has but a little way</div>
      <div class='line'>To flutter—and the Bird is on the Wing.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It is not the dainty sipping of the wine
that our poet commends for the peace of
the soul, but the giving up of self to the enjoyment
of the hour,—the complete abandonment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>that forgets time and space and
eternity, and knows only the moment that is.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Perplext no more with Human or Divine,</div>
      <div class='line'>To-morrow’s tangle to the winds resign,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And lose your fingers in the tresses of</div>
      <div class='line'>The Cypress-slender Minister of Wine.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>This stanza may mean wine,—it may mean
any strong purpose, or intense emotion that
takes possession of our life,—that makes us
its devoted slave, anxious to dare or suffer
for the privilege of enlisting in a cause.
That Omar knew something of life’s pleasures
and realities, besides the wine he
lauded, is apparent from his work. His insight
was so deep that he could not be deceived
by the tinsel and glitter and trappings
that make up the vain show with which men
deceive others, and attempt to beguile themselves.
In Persia eight hundred years ago,
there were probably no twenty-story buildings,
no railroads, nor street cars, nor telegraph
wires; perhaps no chambers of commerce,
nor banks; but no doubt these old
Mohammedans had much as useless and
vain and artificial as these inventions of a
later day. There was then, as now, the
master with all the false luxury that idleness
could create in that land and time; there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>was also, as to-day, the hopeless slave, whose
only purpose on the earth was to minister to
the parasite and knave; and both of these,
master and man alike, were helpless prisoners
in the schemes and devices, the machinery
and inventions, the worthless appendages
and appliances that bound and enslaved
them, and that have held the world with
ever increasing strength to the present day.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Omar knew that all of this was a delusion
and a snare;—that it failed of the
purpose that it meant to serve. He turned
from these vanities to a simpler, saner life,
and found the sweetest and most lasting
pleasures close to the heart of that great nature,
to which man must return from all his
devious wanderings, like the lost child that
comes back to its mother’s breast. What
simpler and higher happiness has all the artificial
civilization of the world been able to
create than this:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A Book of Verses underneath the bough,</div>
      <div class='line'>A Jug of Wine, a Loaf of Bread and Thou</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Beside me singing in the Wilderness—</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh, Wilderness were Paradise enow.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It is these bright spots in life’s desert that
make us long to stay. These hours of
friendship and close companionship of congenial
souls that seem the only pleasures
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>that are real, and from which no regrets
can come. It is away from the bustle and
glare of the world, above its petty strifes,
and its cruel taunts, in the quiet and trust of
true comradeship, that we forget the evil
and fall in love with life. And our old philosopher,
with all his pessimism, with all his
doubts and disappointments, knew that here
was the greatest peace and happiness that
weary, mortal man could know. In the
presence of the friends he loved, and the
comradeship of congenial lives, he could
not but regret the march of time and the
flight of years, which heralded the coming
of the end. Poor Omar was like all the rest
that ever lived—he looked forward into the
dark, unknown sea, and shuddered as he
felt the rising water on his feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>All of us know how small and worthless
are our lives when measured by the infinite
bubbles poured out by the great creative
power. All know that we shall quickly sink
into the great dark sea and the waves will
close above us as if we had not been. And
yet we do not really think of the world as
moving on the same when we have spoken
our last lines and retired behind the scenes.
To the world we are little,—to ourselves we
are all. We almost hope that for a time at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>least we shall be missed,—that some souls
shall sorrow and some lives feel pain. We
hope that here and there some pilgrim will
tell of a burden that we helped him bear, or
a road we tried to smooth. That sometime
when the merry feast is on, a former friend
shall feel a momentary shadow rest upon his
heart at the thought of the face he used to
know and the voice that now is still. Thus
Omar and FitzGerald mused and hoped and
told in beautiful, pathetic lines:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Yon rising Moon that looks for us again—</div>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>

The work of Whitman stands
alone in the literature of the
world. Both in substance
and construction he ignored
all precedents and dared to
be himself. All the rules of
form and taste must be unlearned
before the world can accept his style
as true literary art. Still it may be that Walt
Whitman was a poet, and that sometime the
world will look back and marvel at the mechanical
precision and glittering polish that
confines and emasculates for the sake of a
purely artificial form.</p>

<p class='c000'>Measured by the common rules, Whitman’s
work is neither poetry nor prose; it
is remotely allied to the wild chanting of
the primitive bards, who looked about at
the fresh new marvels of earth and sky and
sea, and unhampered by forms and rules
and customs, sang of the miracles of the
universe and the mysteries of life. Whitman
seems one of those old bards, fresh
from the hand of nature, young with the
first creation, the newest handwork of the
great Master, untaught in any schools, unfettered
by any of the myriad chords, which
time is ever weaving about the brains and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>hearts and consciences of men as the world
grows gray; a primitive bard of nature,
born by some chance or accident in this old,
tired, worn-out world, dropped into this
Nineteenth century with its machines and
conventions, its artificial life, its unnatural
morals and its fettered limbs. He alone in
all the ages seems to have been specially
given to the world, still fresh with the imprint
of the Creator’s hand, and standing
amid all our false conventions, natural,
simple, true, “naked and not ashamed.”
To the world with its crowded cities, its diseased
bodies, its unnatural desires, its narrow
religion, and its false morals, he comes
like a breeze of the morning, from the
mountains or the sea. Aye, like a breath of
that great, creative life, which touched the
fresh world and brought forth the green
grass, the sparkling waters and the growing,
beauteous, natural earth.</p>

<p class='c000'>No one ever fell in love with Whitman’s
work for its literary art, but his work must
live or die because of his philosophy of life
and the material he chose from which to
weave his songs. It is in his whole point of
view that Walt Whitman stands so much
alone. No one else has ever looked on the
universe and life as this man did. If religion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>means devotion to that great unseen
power that is ever manifest in all of nature’s
works, then Walt Whitman was the most
reverent soul that ever lived. This man
alone of all the world dared defend the
Creator in every part and parcel of his
work. The high mountains, the deep valleys,
the broad plains and the wide seas; the
feelings, the desires, and the passions of
man; all forms of life and being that exist
upon the earth, were to him but several
manifestations of a great creative power that
formed them all alike, made each one needful
to the whole, and every portion sacred
through its Master’s stamp.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And I will show that there is no imperfection in the present and can be none in the future,</div>
      <div class='line'>And I will show that whatever happens to anybody it may be turn’d to beautiful results,</div>
      <div class='line'>And I will show that nothing can happen more beautiful than death.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And I will thread a thread through my poems that time and events are compact,</div>
      <div class='line'>And that all the things of the universe are perfect miracles, each as profound as any.</div>
      <div class='line'>I will not make poems with reference to parts.</div>
      <div class='line'>But I will make poems, songs, thoughts, with reference to ensemble,</div>
      <div class='line'>And I will not sing with reference to a day, but with reference to all days.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>Whitman’s philosophy knew no evil and
no wrong. The fact of existence proved
the right of existence; in the great workshop
of nature every tool had its special use
and its rightful place.</p>

<p class='c000'>The imperfections of the world come
from the narrow visions of men. If the
perspective is right, the universe is right.
From the narrow valley the house may look
old and worn, the fences decayed, the fields
barren, the woods scraggy and the cliff
ragged and bare; but climb to the only
place where either life or landscape can be
rightly seen, the mountain top, and look
once more. The hills, the valley, the
stream, the woods, and the farms have
melted and blended into one harmonious
whole, and every imperfection has been
swept away. The universe is filled with
myriad worlds as important as our own, each
one a tiny floating speck in an endless sea of
space—each whirling, turning, moving on
and on and on, through the countless ages,
past and yet to come. No one can tell the
purpose of their tireless, endless flight
through space; but still we know that each
has an orbit of its own, and every world is
related to the rest, and every grain of sand
and the weakest, feeblest spark of power has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>its needful place in the balance of the whole.
So all of good, and all of bad, and all of life,
and all of death, and all of all, has the right
to be and must needs be. Walt Whitman
did not even know how to divide the evil
from the good, but he sang them both
alike.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I am not the poet of goodness only, I do not decline to be the poet of wickedness also.</div>
      <div class='line'>What blurt is this about virtue and about vice?</div>
      <div class='line'>Evil propels me and reform of evil propels me, I stand indifferent.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The universe can make no mistakes, every
particle of energy that has permeated the
world since time began, has been working
toward a completer system and a more harmonious
whole. There is a soul of truth in
error; there is a soul of good in evil. From
the trials and sorrows and disappointments
of life, even from its bitterness and doubt
and sin, are often born the holiest desires,
the sincerest endeavors and the most righteous
deeds.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Sometimes with one I love I fill myself with rage for fear I effuse unreturn’d love,</div>
      <div class='line'>But now I think there is no unreturn’d love, the pay is certain one way or another,</div>
      <div class='line'>(I loved a certain person ardently and my love was not return’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet out of that I have written these songs.)</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>This is the old, old philosophy, ever forgotten,
yet ever present. It is sure in the
world of mechanics, it is equally true in the
world of morals and of life. Nothing is
lost; the force that once was heat is transformed
to light; the flood that destroyed
the grain, comes at last to turn the miller’s
wheel. What we call sin and evil make the
experiences of life and go to the upbuilding
of character and the development of man.
We can know only what we have felt, and
however much we try to deceive others, we
can tell only of the experiences we ourselves
have had. The poorest life is the one that
has no tale to tell. In the doubts and darkness
of life, in the turbulence of mind and
the anguish of the soul, it is most consoling
to feel that resignation and confidence which
comes from a realization that all is right and
that you are master of yourself and at peace
with God and man. This calm, optimistic,
self-reliant philosophy is ever present with
its consoling power in all Walt Whitman’s
work.</p>

<p class='c000'>This is not the boasting of the ignorant
egotist who vaunts himself above his fellow

great soul, who has learned the patient philosophy
of life.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>There is an egotism that is cheap and vulgar
and born of ignorance alone. There is
an egotism that comes from the knowledge
that after all what we are depends not upon
the estimate of the world, but upon the integrity
and character of ourselves. This
consciousness of individual worth brings
that peace of soul, “which the world can
neither give nor take away.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Happy is the man that has climbed to the
height on which Walt Whitman stood.
Happy is he that has mastered the haste and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>impatience of youth, and is content to bide
his time. Happy is he that has so far solved
the problem of life as to know that reward
is not received from others and cannot be
withheld by others, but can be given only by
ourselves. Such a man has struck the subtle
harmony which unites his soul with the
universal life and he knows that no one but
himself can cut the cord.</p>

<p class='c000'>To a great mass of men and women, Walt
Whitman is known almost alone by that
portion of his work called “Children of
Adam.” These poems have called forth the
fiercest opposition and the bitterest denunciation,
and if the common judgment is
correct, they are obscene and vile. While
this portion of his book is by far the smallest
part, still, before the court of public
opinion, he must stand or fall upon these
lines. In one sense public opinion is right,
for unless these stanzas can be defended, his
point of view is wrong, and Walt Whitman’s
work will die. We need not accept all he
did, or give unstinted praise to all his work,
but his scheme is consistent in every portion
of his thought, and his point of view will
determine the place he shall fill in art and
life.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is in this work that the courage and personality
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>of Whitman towers so high above
every other man that ever wrote. It is easy
for the essayist to speak in general terms
and glittering phrases in defense of Whitman’s
work. His defenders have been
many, but he alone has had the courage to
speak.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is not difficult to insist that his “A Woman
Waits for Me” is a tremendous work,
and as pure as nature’s generating power.
Still perhaps few would dare to read it aloud
in an assembly of men and women. If
Whitman is right, the world is wrong. This
poem, and others of its like, in plain words
deals of the deepest, strongest, most persistent
feelings that move the sentient world.
In proportion as they are deeper and
stronger than any other, they should the
more be the subject of thought and art.
And still ages of established convention have
made the world pretend ignorance until no
one dares defend his right to life but this
brave and simple man.</p>

<p class='c000'>In both England and America, narrow interpretations
of morality have almost stifled
art. As remarked by a leading novelist—“All
our literature is addressed to the young
school girl.” If it will not pass muster before
her eyes, it has no right to live, and almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>no English or American author has
been great enough to rise above these narrow
conventions and write the natural and
true. The artists of continental Europe
have been less fettered and have taken us
over a broader range and a wider field.
Still while these authors have told more of
life, they have treated these tremendous
subjects by drawing the curtain only a little
way aside, and giving us a curious, perverted,
half stolen look, as if they knew that the picture
was unholy and therefore tempting to
the gaze. But Walt Whitman approached
the human body and the mysteries of life
from an entirely different view.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>If anything is sacred, the human body is sacred,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the glory and sweet of man is the token of manhood untainted,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>If Walt Whitman could have drawn the
veil from the universe and shown us the living
God in all his majesty and power, he
would have approached his throne with no
greater reverence than when he stripped the
human body and pointed to its every part
fresh and sacred from its Maker’s hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>No true system of life and morals will exist
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>until the holiest feelings and most potent
and eternal power is openly recognized and
discussed with neither jest nor shame.</p>

<p class='c000'>Walt Whitman was the great bard of democracy
and equality; not simply the vulgar
democracy of political rights and promiscuous
familiarity, but the deep, broad,
fundamental democracy that looks at all of
nature and feels the unity and kinship that
makes the universe a whole.</p>

<p class='c000'>To Walt Whitman there could be no
thought of class or caste. Each one held
his certificate of birth from the same infinite
power that, through all the ages and all the
false and criminal distinctions of man, has
yet decreed that all shall enter helpless and
naked through the same gateway of birth,
and each alike must go back to the fundamental
mother, shorn of every distinction
that man in his vain-glorious pride has
sought to make. Whitman placed the
works of nature above the works of man.
He had no faith in those laws and institutions
which the world has ever made to defraud,
and enslave, and deny the common
brotherhood of all. He believed that every
child that came upon the earth was legitimate,
and had an equal right to land, and
sea, and air, and all that nature made, and
all that nature gave.</p>

      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>Each of us is inevitable,</div>
      <div class='line'>Each of us limitless—each of us with his or her right upon the earth,</div>
      <div class='line'>Each of us allow’d the eternal purports of the earth,</div>
      <div class='line'>Each of us here as divinely as any is here.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Let this stanza speak to our conscience
face to face—is it true or false? Can any
but a blasphemer deny the divine right of
every man upon the earth? And yet if this
simple stanza is true, every law book should
be burned and every court abolished and
natural justice, unfettered and undenied,
should be enthroned above the forms and
conventions and laws, which, each and all,
deny the integrity of the soul and the equal
rights of man.</p>

<p class='c000'>Through all the injustice and inequality of
the world, the vision of democracy has still
prevailed and ever must prevail as long as
nature brings forth and takes back the master
and the slave alike. But the aspiration
for democracy is not always high and noble.
It is easy to demand for ourselves the same
rights enjoyed by our fellow men, but Whitman’s
democracy was on a higher plane.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>These lines breathe the spirit of true humanity,
the spirit that will one day remove
all barriers and restrictions, and liberate the
high and low alike. For nothing is truer in

</div>

<p class='c000'>It is a sad mistake to believe that injustice
and wrong can injure only the poor and the
weak. Every mean word and narrow
thought and selfish act degrades the aggressor,
leaves its mark upon his soul and its
penalty in his life. So, too, no good effort
is really lost, however it may seem to be.
The kind word may be spoken to the deaf,
the righteous effort be wrongly directed, the
alms unworthily bestowed, but the heart
that feels and the soul that tries has grown
greater by the act.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Not alone in his theory of personal equality
was Walt Whitman a democrat in the
highest meaning of the term, but he distrusted
the ease and effeminacy of modern
life; he doubted and feared the polish and
super-sensitiveness that precedes decay; he
had no faith in hot-house plants, in pampered
life, in luxury and repose. He believed in
rugged, primeval nature, in the rocks and
hills, the rivers and the pines; he loved the
dumb and patient brute, and believed in
stalwart men and strong women; in sunlight,
rain and air.</p>

      <div class='line'>Not one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Walt Whitman’s work is not of the old,
time-worn sort. When he speaks of love it
is the love of life, the love of reality, the
strong love of men, the intense love of women,
the honest love that nature made, the
love that is; not the unhealthy, immoral,
false, impossible love told in erotic prose
and more erotic verse, and given to young
girls and boys as the truth, to poison and
corrupt with its false and vicious views of
life.</p>

<p class='c000'>But he sings of the common things, the
democracy of every day; for it is the small
affairs that make up life, and its true philosophy
is to see the beauty and greatness and
relation of these little things and not to pine
for the seemingly momentous events, which
can rarely come. The Alexanders, the
Cæsars and the Napoleons are scattered
only here and there in the great sea of human
existence, and yet every life measured
by just standards may be as great as these;
and the soul that is conscious of its own integrity
knows its own worth regardless of
the world.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Walt Whitman felt the music of the hammer
and the axe as he felt the harmony of
the symphonies of Beethoven, and he understood
the art of the plough-boy in the
field as well as the glorious creations of
Millet.</p>

      <div class='line'>The girl and the wife rest the needle a moment and forget where they are,</div>
      <div class='line'>They and all would resume what I have told them.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Walt Whitman’s democracy did not end
with sex. Man is not always a logical animal.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>Most of the practical democracy of
the world has stopped with men, and generally
with white men at that. The political
equality of woman has only barely been
considered; the still more important question,
her economic independence, is yet a
far-off dream. But Walt Whitman knew no
limit to equality. With him equality meant
equality. It could mean nothing else.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I am the poet of the woman the same as the man,</div>
      <div class='line'>And I say it is as great to be a woman as to be a man,</div>
      <div class='line'>And I say there is nothing greater than the mother of men.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Probably Walt Whitman would not have
raised his hat to a woman on the street, nor
given her his seat in the car, simply because
she was a woman. Both these may be well
enough, but they grow from false ideas of
women and of course through these false
ideas women lose the most. Injustice and
oppression can never be made up by chivalry
and pretended courtesy. And the evil
always is and must be the false relation which
these create. Men expect to pay women
for their political and economic freedom in
theater tickets and by taking off their hats in
public, and in the end women become willing
to receive this paltry and debasing bribe.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>“The Open Road,” one of Whitman’s
masterpieces, is full of wholesome inclusive
democracy.</p>

      <div class='line'>The black with his woolly head, the felon, the diseas’d, the illiterate person, are not denied;</div>
      <div class='line'>The birth, the hasting after the physician, the beggar’s tramp, the drunkard’s stagger, the laughing party of mechanics,</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>But Walt Whitman’s democracy was more
inclusive still. It is almost becoming the
fad to forgive the evil in others and to insist
that, after all, their good qualities give them
the right to kinship with ourselves, but this
is only one side of true democracy. The
felon is my brother, not alone because he
has every element of good that I so well
recognize in myself, but because I have
every element of evil that I see in him.
Walt Whitman was wise enough to see the
feelings and passions that make others sin,
and he was just enough and great enough to
recognize all these feelings in himself.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>These lines are not a burst of poetic feeling,
they are the sincere utterances of a
brave philosopher and poet, who tells the
truth about himself and about you and me.
Let us be honest about sin. How do you
and I differ from the murderer on the gallows,
the prostitute in the street or the burglar
in the jail? How wide a breach is
there between coveting the house or home
or seal skin coat of your neighbor and taking
it if you can? How great a difference
between making a sharp trade with your
neighbor, getting more from him than you
give to him, and taking outright what he
has? Yet one is business, the other larceny.
What is the distance between hating your
neighbor, and wishing him dead: how great
a chasm between feeling relief at his death,
and killing him yourself? So far as the man
is concerned, it is not the act that is evil,
but the heart that is evil. There is no difference
between the committed and the uncommitted
crime. Every feeling that makes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>every sort of crime is in the heart of each
and every one. Nature has made the blood
of some of us a little cooler, and has developed
caution a little more, or fate has
made the temptation a trifle less, and thus we
have escaped,—that is, managed to conceal
the real passion that boils and surges in our
hearts. Until this is dead, evil is in our
souls. Away with all this talk of superiority
and differences. It is cant—pure, simple
cant.</p>

      <div class='line'>I will be more to you than to any of the rest.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Has man the right to be less kind than nature
is? Have we the right by word or deed
to pass judgment on our fellow man? Can
we not learn of love and charity and hope
from the sun, the rain, the generous earth,
and the pulsing, growing spring? Hear
Walt Whitman’s word to a common prostitute:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Be composed—be at ease with me—I am Walt Whitman, liberal and lusty as Nature,</div>
      <div class='line'>Not till the sun excludes you do I exclude you,</div>
      <div class='line'>Not till the waters refuse to glisten for you and the leaves to rustle for you do my words refuse to glisten and rustle for you.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>Neither was it the magnanimous soul of
Whitman that was charitable and kind, but
it was the truthful, honest man who saw his
own goodness in the woman; and her sin,
which after all was only an excess of kindness,
in himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>The regenerated world will be built upon
the democracy Walt Whitman taught. It
will know neither rich nor poor; neither
high nor low; neither good nor bad; neither
right nor wrong; but</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I will establish *** in every city of these states inland and seaboard,</div>
      <div class='line'>In the fields and woods, and above every keel, little or large, that dents the water,</div>
      <div class='line'>Without edifices or rules or trustees or any argument,</div>
      <div class='line'>The institution of the dear love of comrades.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Walt Whitman was always and at all times
an optimist. He never struck a despairing
note or voiced a doubting strain. His hope
was not anchored in blind faith or narrow
creed. His optimism was not that of the
cowardly fanatic who stubbornly shuts his
eyes to avoid an unpleasant view. He looked
abroad at all the world and called it good.</p>

<p class='c000'>Optimism and pessimism in their last analysis
are questions of temperament. They
depend upon the eye that looks out, not
upon the object that it sees. The pessimist
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>points to the sunset, casting its lengthening
shadows on the earth, and tells of the night
that is coming on; the optimist shows us the
rosy dawn, the golden promise of a glorious
day. The pessimist tells of winter, whose
icy breath chills and deadens all the world;
the optimist points to springtime with its
ever recurring miracle of light and life. Is
the pessimist right or is the optimist right—does
the night precede the day, or the day
precede the night? After all, are our calendars
wrong—does the winter with its
white shroud and cold face mark the ending
of the year, or does the springtime with its
budding life and its resurrecting power
awaken the dead earth to joyous, pulsing
life again?</p>

<p class='c000'>Above the view of the optimist, who sees
the morning and the spring, and the pessimist,
who sees the evening and the closing
year, stand a few serene souls, who look on
both with clear eye and tranquil mind, and
declare that all is good. The morning is
right and the evening is right. It is beautiful
to pass through the joyous gates of birth;
it is good to be clasped in the peaceful arms
of death. Rare Walt Whitman at thirty-seven,
full of health and vigor and strength,
with the world before him, and conscious of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>his genius and his power, sings in a burst of
optimism:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I celebrate myself, and sing myself,</div>
      <div class='line'>And what I assume you shall assume,</div>
      <div class='line'>For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I loafe and invite my soul,</div>
      <div class='line'>I lean and loafe at my ease, observing a spear of summer grass.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>My tongue, every atom of my blood, form’d from this soil, this air,</div>
      <div class='line'>Born of parents born here from parents the same, and their parents the same,</div>
      <div class='line'>I, now thirty-seven years old in perfect health begin,</div>
      <div class='line'>Hoping to cease not till death.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Again at seventy, looking back on a life
well spent, conscious that the last few sands
are running out, a confirmed invalid with
palsied limbs and failing strength, looking
death squarely in the face and just before
him; with the same sweet smile, the same
lovely nature, the same all-embracing philosophy,
sings once again his optimistic song:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Not from successful love alone,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor wealth, nor honor’d middle age, nor victories of politics or war;</div>
      <div class='line'>But as life wanes, and all the turbulent passions calm,</div>
      <div class='line'>As gorgeous, vapory, silent hues cover the evening sky,</div>
      <div class='line'>As softness, fulness, rest, suffuse the frame, like fresher, balmier air,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>As the days take on a mellower light, and the apple at last hangs really finish’d and indolent-ripe on the tree,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then for the teeming, quietest, happiest days of all!</div>
      <div class='line'>The brooding, blissful halcyon days!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It must be that somewhere is a serene
height where life triumphs over death. It
must be that nature does not jar, and that
the close of a lovely life is really as peaceful
and as beautiful as the decline of a perfect
day; that each day rightly lived and every
year well spent, must bring the pilgrim more
in harmony with his journey drawing to a
close.</p>

<p class='c000'>The world has ever shuddered at death—has
stubbornly closed its eyes and refused to
look at the great fact that nature places all
about our path; has never tried to look in
its face, to take its hand, to think of its peaceful,
forgiving, soothing touch; has ever
called it enemy and never thought to caress
it as a friend. Walt Whitman was wiser
than the rest. His philosophy made him
know that death was equally good, whether
the opening gateway to a freer, fuller life, or
a restful couch for a weary soul.</p>

he had conquered death; he looked at her
pale form and saluted her as he would welcome

<p class='c000'>Whitman in his wheel chair, physically
shattered and broken, but with a mind
strong and serene, and at peace with all the
world, waiting for the sun to set, is a lesson
in optimism better than all the sermons ever
preached. Without faith in any form of religion
that the world has ever known, he
had brought his life so in harmony with nature
that he felt every beat of the great,
universal heart, and with the confidence of
certain knowledge he looked upon the fading
earth and caroled a song as he sailed
forth on that great unknown sea, which is
hidden in perpetual night, from all but the
few great souls, whose wisdom and insight
have given them the confidence and trust of
a little child.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>When man has grown simpler and saner
and truer—when the fever of civilization has
been subdued and the pestilence been
cured; when man shall no longer deny and
revile the universal mother who gave him
birth, then Walt Whitman’s day will come.
In the clear light of that regenerated time,
when the world looks back to the doubt and
mist and confusion of to-day, Walt Whitman
will stand alone, the greatest, truest, noblest
prophet of the age, a man untainted by artificial
life and unmoved by the false standards
of his time. In a sodden, commercial,
money-getting age, he enjoyed all the beauty
of the earth without the vulgar lust to own.
In a world of privilege and caste, he felt and
taught the brotherhood of man and the kinship
of all living things. In an age of false
modesty and perverted thought, he sang the
sanctity of the body with the divinity of the
soul. Against the agnostic and the Christian
too, he defended every part and portion of
the faultless work of the creative power.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>Above the doleful, doubting voice of men,
through the dreariest day and darkest night,
in the raging of the storm and the madness
of the waves, his strong, optimistic, reassuring
note was ever heard above the rest, proclaiming
to the universe that all is well. He
saw that in a wise economy and a great
broad way, that the false was true, the evil
good, the wrong was right, and that over all
the universe, pervading all its teeming life,
a power omnipotent, beneficent and wise,
was working to uplift, conserve and purify
the whole. The poor, the weak, the suffering,
the outcast, the felon, all knew him for
their comrade and their friend. His great,
inclusive, universal heart left no soul outside,
but all alike he knew, the life of all he felt,
and one and all he loved. In his vocabulary
were no words of bitterness and hate,
and in his philosophy no right to censure or
to blame. In his every deed and thought
he seemed to say:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“So I be written in the book of love,</div>
      <div class='line'>I have no care about that book above,</div>
      <div class='line'>Erase my name, or write it as you please,</div>
      <div class='line'>So I be written in the book of love.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>As the shadows lengthen and the daylight
wanes—as the hair whitens and the passions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>cool, more and more do we learn that love
is the true philosophy of life; more and more
do we revise the sterner judgments of our
earlier years; more and more do we see
that pity should take the place of blame,
forgiveness of punishment, charity of
justice, and hatred be replaced by love.
When old familiar faces awake the memories
of bygone days, often and often again
do we fear that our judgments were cruel
and unjust, but every deed of mercy and
every act of charity and every thought of
pity is like the balm of Gilead to our souls.
We may none of us be wise or great, fortune
may elude us and fame may never come;
but however poor or weak or humble, we
yet may inscribe our names in the fairest,
brightest book,—the book of love, and on
its sacred pages, earned by the glorious
truths he taught, by his infinite, ever present
love of all, upon the foremost line will be
inscribed Walt Whitman’s name.</p>

It is difficult to account for a
genius like Robert Burns.
His life and work seem to
defy the laws of heredity and
environment alike. The
beasts of the field were
scarcely bound closer to the
soil than were the ancestors from which he
sprang; and from his early infancy he was
forced to follow the stony path his father
trod before. As a mere child, he learned
how hard it is to sustain life in the face of an
unfriendly nature and a cruel, bitter world.
He was early bred to toil; not the work that
gives strength and health, but the hard, constant,
manual labor that degrades and embitters,
deforms and twists and stunts the
body and the soul alike. Burns was denied
even the brief years of childhood—those few,
short years upon which most of us look back
from our disappointments and cares as the
one bright spot in a gray and level plain.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is not alone by the works he has left us
that Robert Burns is to be truly judged.
Fortune endowed him with a wondrous brain
and a still rarer and greater gift—a tender,
loving, universal heart; but as if she grudged
him these and sought to destroy or stunt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>their power, she cast his lot in a social and
religious environment as hard and forbidding
as the cold and sterile soil of his native
land; and from these surroundings alone he
was obliged to draw the warmth and color
and sunshine that should have come from
loving hearts, generous bounties, and bright,
blue southern skies. In measuring the power
and character of Robert Burns, we must
remember the hard and cruel conditions of
his life, and judge of his great achievements
in the light of these.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ways of destiny have ever been beyond
the ken of man; now and then, at rare,
long intervals, she descends upon the earth,
and in her arms she bears disguised a precious
gift, which she lavished upon a blind,
unwilling world. She passes by the gorgeous
palaces and beautiful abodes of men,
and drops the treasure in a manger or a hut;
she comes again to take it back from a world
that knew it not and cast it out; and again,
she seeks it not among the strong and great,
but in the hovel of the poor, the prison pen,
or perhaps upon the scaffold or the block.</p>

<p class='c000'>Measured by the standards of our day and
generation, the life of Robert Burns was a
failure and mistake. He went back to the
great common Mother as naked of all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>gilded trappings and baubles, which men
call wealth, as when she first placed the
struggling infant on its mother’s breast.</p>

<p class='c000'>Robert Burns was not a “business man”;
he was not one of Dumfries’ “first citizens”—in
the measure of that day and this; he
was one of its last if not its worst. He had
no stock in a corporation and no interest in a
syndicate or trust. He had neither a bank
nor bank account. He never endowed a
library, a museum, or a university. He was
a singer of songs,—a dreamer of dreams. He
was poor, improvident, intemperate, and according
to the Scottish creed, immoral and
irreligious. In spite of his great intellect he
was doubted, neglected and despised. He
died in destitution and despair; but the great
light of his genius, which his neighbors could
not see or comprehend, has grown brighter
and clearer as the years have rolled away. A
beautiful mausoleum now holds his once
neglected ashes; monuments have been reared
to his memory wherever worth is known
and fame preserved; while millions of men
and women, the greatest and the humblest
of the world alike, have felt their own heartstrings
moved and stirred in unison with the
music of this immortal bard, whose song was
the breath of Nature,—the sweetest, tenderest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>melody that ever came from that rarest
instrument—the devoted poet’s soul.</p>

<p class='c000'>The great masterpieces of his genius were
not created in the pleasant study of a home
of refinement, luxury, and ease, but were born
in the fields, the farm yard, the stable; while
the “monarch peasant” was bending above
the humblest tasks that men pursue for
bread. Only the most ordinary education
was within the reach of this child of toil,
and the world’s great storehouses of learning,
literature, and art were sealed forever
from his sight; and yet, with only the rude
peasants, with whom his life was spent, the
narrow setting of bleak fields and grey hills,
which was the small stage on which he
moved, and the sterile Scotch dialect with
which to paint, he stirred the hearts of men
with the sweetest, highest, purest melody
that has ever moved the human soul.</p>

<p class='c000'>Olive Schreiner tells of an artist whose
pictures shone with the richest, brightest
glow. His admirers gazed upon the canvas
and wondered where he found the colors—so
much rarer than any they had ever seen
before. Other artists searched the earth,
but could find no tints like his; he died with
the secret in his breast. And when they undressed
him to put his grave-clothes on,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>they found an old wound, hard and jagged
above his heart; and still they wondered
where he found the coloring for his work.
Robert Burns, perhaps more than any other
man who ever lived, taught the great truth
that poets are not made but born; that the
richest literature, the brightest gems of art,
even the most pleasing earthly prospects are
less than one spark of the divine fire, which
alone can kindle the true light. Robert
Burns like all great artists, taught the world
that the beauty of the landscape, and the
grandeur and pathos of life depend, not
upon the external objects that nature has
chanced to place before our view, but upon
the soul of the artist, which alone can really
see and interpret the manifold works of the
great author, beside which all human effort
is so poor and weak.</p>

<p class='c000'>Millet looked at the French peasants
standing in their wooden shoes, digging
potatoes from the earth and pausing to bow
reverently at the sounding of the Angelus,
and saw in this simple life, so close to Nature’s
heart, more beauty and pathos and
poetry than all the glittering courts of
Europe could produce. And Robert Burns,
whose broad mind and sympathetic soul
made him kin to all living things, had no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>need to see the splendor and gaiety of wealth
and power, to visit foreign shores and unknown
lands; but the flowers, the heather,
the daisies, the bleak fields, the pelting
rains, the singing birds, the lowing cattle,
and above all, the simple country folk seen
through his eyes, and felt by his soul, and
held in his all-embracing heart, were covered
with a beauty and a glory that all the
artificial world could not create, and that his
genius has endowed with immortal life.
Robert Burns did not borrow his philosophy
from the books, his humanity from the
church, or his poetry from the schools.
Luckily for us he escaped all these, and unfettered
and untaught, went straight to the
soul of Nature to learn from the great
source, the harmony and beauty and unity
that pervades the whole; and he painted
these with colors drawn from his great human
heart. His universal sympathy gave
him an insight into life that students of science
and philosophy can never reach. Contemplating
Nature, and seeing her generous
bounties lavished alike on all her children,
he could not but contrast this with the selfishness
and inhumanity of man, which
crushes out the weak and helpless and builds
up the great and strong. Burns was a natural
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>leveler, and while men still believed in
the “divine right of kings,” he preached
that “man was the divine King of rights.”
None knew better than he the injustice of
the social life in which he lived, and in
which we live to-day. Burns knew, as all
men of intelligence understand, that worldly
goods are not, and never have been given
as a reward of either brains or merit.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>It’s hardly in a body’s power</div>

<p class='c000'>The immortal singer of songs, and all his
descendants, received infinitely less for all
the works of his genius than an ordinary
gambler often gets for one sale of something
that he never owned, or one purchase of
something that he never bought; and it is
doubtful if all the masterpieces of the world
in art, in literature, and in science, ever
brought as much cash to those whose great,
patient brains have carefully and honestly
wrought that the earth might be richer and
better and brighter, as has been often
“made” by one inferior speculator upon a
single issue of watered stock.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>Living in the midst of aristocracy and
privilege and caste, Burns was a democrat
that believed in the equality of man. It required
no books or professors, or theories to
teach him the injustice of the social conditions
under which the world has ever lived.
Here, as elsewhere, he looked to the heart—a
teacher infinitely more honest and reliable
than the brain.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Preachers and authors and teachers, judges
and professors and lawyers, have been employed
for ages to teach the justice of
slavery and the folly and crime of equal
rights; but through all quibbles and evasions,
this question of Burns, straight from
the heart, as well as the head, shows that all
these excuses are but snares and cheats.
The voice of the French Revolution could
not fail to move a soul like that of Robert
Burns. This great struggle for human liberty
came upon the world with almost the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>suddenness of an earthquake, and with
much of its terrors, too. Here the poor and
the oppressed felt the first substantial hope
for freedom that had pierced the long, dark
centuries since history told the acts of men.
To the oppressors and the powerful, who
hated liberty then as they ever have, before
and since, it was a wild, dread threat of destruction
and ruin to their precious “rights.”
When the struggle commenced, Burns was
enjoying the munificent salary of Fifty
pounds a year as a whisky gauger in the village
of Dumfries. He had already spent a
winter in Edinburgh, and had been feted
and dined by the aristocracy and culture of
Scotland’s capital without losing his head,
although at no small risk. An acquaintance
and entertainer of the nobility and an incumbent
of a lucrative office, there was but
one thing for Burns to do; this was to condemn
the Revolution and lend his trenchant
pen to the oppressor’s cause; but this
course he flatly refused to take. He openly
espoused the side of the people, and wrote
the “Tree of Liberty,” one of his most
stirring songs, in its defense.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Even these words are not strong enough
to express his love for natural liberty and his
distrust of those forms and institutions which
over and over again have crushed the priceless
gem they pretend to protect.</p>

      <div class='line in2'>Churches built to please the priest.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Even higher and broader was Burns’ view
of equality and right. He stood on a serene
height, where he looked upon all the strife
and contention of individuals and states,
and dreamed of a perfect harmony and universal
order, where men and Nations alike
should be at peace, and the world united in
one grand common brotherhood, where the
fondest wish of each should be the highest
good of all. These beautiful, prophetic
lines seem to speak of a day as distant now
as when Burns wrote them down a hundred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>years ago. But still, all men that love the
human race will ever hope, and work, and
say with him:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Then let us pray that come it may,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>As come it will for a’ that,</div>

      <div class='line'>That man to man, the warld o’er,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Shall brothers be for a’ that.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It is perhaps as a singer of songs that the
literary fame of Burns will longest be preserved.
No other poet has ever breathed
such music from his soul. His melodies are
as sweet and pure as the bubbling spring;
and as natural and spontaneous as ever came
from the throat of the nightingale or lark.
These songs could not be made. The feeling
and passion that left his soul bore this
music as naturally as the zephyr that has
fanned the strings of the Æolian harp. The
meter of these songs was not learned by
scanning Latin verse, or studying the dry
rules that govern literary art, but it was born
of the regular pulse beats, which in the
heart of Nature’s poets are as smooth and
unstudied as the rippling laughter of her
purling brooks.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although a plough boy and surrounded
by the grime and dirt that come from contact
with the soil, still even here Burns found material
for music and poetry that will live as
long as human hearts endure; for, though
the sky may be warmer and bluer on the
Mediterranean shore than where it domes the
Scottish hills and crags, still the same heaven
bends above them both, and the same infinite
mysteries are hidden in their unfathomed
depths. The tragedy of death is alike,
whether defying the power of a Prince, or
entering the home of the humblest peasant
to bring the first moments of relief and rest.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>The miracle of life, whether wrought by
Nature on the rich couch of the Queen or
the unwatched pallet of the peasant, is the
same mystery, ever new, ever old, appealing
ever to the heart of man. The affections
and passions,—those profound feelings that
Nature planted deep in the being of all sentient
things, and on whose strength all life
depends,—these are the deepest and purest
as we leave the conventions and trappings
of the artificial world, and draw nearer to
the heart of the great Universal power.
With the sky above, the fields around, and
all Nature throbbing and teeming with
pulsing life, but one thing more was needed
to make harmony and music, and that was
Robert Burns.</p>

<p class='c000'>The old story of human love was sung by
him a thousand times and in a thousand varying
moods, as never love was sung before.
It mattered not that his melodies breathed
of rustic scenes, of country maids, and of
plain untutored hearts that beat as Nature
made them feel, unfettered by the restraints
and cords of an artificial life. Transport his
Mary to a gorgeous palace, and deck her
fair form with the richest treasures of the
earth and bring to her side the proudest
noble that ever paid homage to a princess,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>and no singer,—not even Burns himself,—could
make a melody like the matchless music
that he sung to Highland Mary.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>How sweetly bloom’d the gay green birk,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>How rich the hawthorn’s blossom;</div>
      <div class='line'>As underneath their fragrant shade,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>I clasp’d her to my bosom!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The golden hours, on angel wings,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>Was my sweet Highland Mary.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>All the conventions and baubles and spangles
which fashion and custom use to adorn
the fair could only have cheapened and
made vulgar the rustic maiden that moved
Burns’ soul to song.</p>

<p class='c000'>These sweet lines could never have been
written of any but a simple country lass,
whose natural charms had moved a susceptible
human heart:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I see her in the dewy flowers,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>I see her sweet and fair;</div>
      <div class='line'>I hear her in the tunefu’ birds,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>But minds me o’ my Jean.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>Who was this Burns that sang these sweet
songs and whose musical soul was stirred by
every breeze and moved to poetry by every
lovely face and form that came within his
view? Biographers and critics and admirers
have praised the genius and begged excuses
for the man. Without asking charity for
this illustrious singer, let us view him in the
light of justice, exactly as he was. It is not
difficult to understand the character of
Robert Burns. His heart was generous and
warm and kind; his mind was open as the
day, and his soul was sensitive to every
breath that stirred the air. These qualities
have made the poet loved in every land on
earth, and brought more pilgrims to his
grave than were ever drawn to the tomb of
any other poet or author that has ever lived
and died. And yet the short-sighted, carping,
moralizing world, with solemn voice
and wisdom ill-assumed, has ever told how
much better and holier he could have been
and should have been. Poor, silly, idle
world, can you never learn that the qualities
that make us strong must also make us weak;
that the heart that melts at suffering and
pain is made of clay so sensitive and fine as
to be moved and swayed by all the emotions
of the soul? Would you serve the weak, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>suffering and the poor—would you calm
their fears and dry their eyes and feel with
them the cruel woes of life—you must wear
your heart upon your sleeve, and then of
course the daws will peck it into bits.
Would you keep it safely hidden from the
daws, you must hide it in a breast of stone
or ice and keep it only for yourself. Perhaps
we may admire the man that walks
with steady step along a straight and narrow
path, unmoved by all the world outside.
He never feels and never errs. But we cannot
ask of either man the virtues that belong
to both, and when our choice is made we
must take the strength and weakness too.</p>

<p class='c000'>We look at the mountain top, lifting its
snow-crowned head high into the everlasting
blue, and are moved with wonder and
with awe. Above is the endless sky; below,
the world with all its bickering and strife,
the clouds, the lightning and the storm, but
the mountain, cold, impassive, changeless,
unmoved by all the world, looks ever upward
to the eternal heavens above. Again
we gaze on the peaceful, fertile lowlands,
rich with their generous harvests yet unborn—beautiful
with their winding streams and
grassy fields, ever ready to bestow bounteously
on all that ask, demanding little and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>lavishly returning all; and we love the quiet,
rustic, generous beauty of the scene. The
mountain is majestic and sublime, and the
yielding, generous lowlands are beautiful
and pleasing too. We love them both, but
we cannot have them both at once and both
in one.</p>

<p class='c000'>Robert Burns, and all men like him that
ever lived, were always giving from their
generous souls. In the cold judgment of the
world, Burns wasted many a gem upon the
thoughtless, worthless crowd, who consumed
a life he should have spent for nobler
things. But the flower that never wastes its
fragrance has no perfume to give out. If it
is truly sweet, its strength is borne away on
every idle wind that blows. Robert Burns
with lavish bounty shed his life and fragrance
on every soul he met. He loved them all
and loved them well: his sensitive, harmonious
soul vibrated to every touch, and
moved in perfect harmony with every heart
that came within his reach. The lives of
men like him are one long harmony; but as
they pass along the stage of life, they leave
a trail of disappointed hopes, and broken
hearts, and vain regrets. But of all the
tragedies great and small that mark their
path, the greatest far and most pathetic is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>the sad and hopeless wreck that ever surely
falls upon the exhausted artist’s life.</p>

<p class='c000'>The life of Burns was filled with wrecks—with
promises made and broken, with hopes
aroused, and then dashed to earth again. It
was filled with these because one man cannot
give himself personally to all the world.
The vices of Robert Burns perhaps like
those of all the rest that ever lived, were
virtues carried to excess. Of course, the
world could not understand it then, and
cannot understand it now, and perhaps it
never will, for slander and malice and envy,
like death, always love a shinning mark.
The life of Burns and the life of each is the
old Greek fable told again. Achilles’ mother
would make him invulnerable by dipping
him in the river Styx. She held him by the
heel, which remained unwashed and vulnerable,
and finally brought him to his
death. To whatever dizzy height we climb,
and however invulnerable we seek to be,
there still remains with all the untouched
heel that binds us to the earth. And after
all, this weak and human spot, is the truest
bond of kinship that unites the world.</p>

<p class='c000'>I look back at Robert Burns, at the poor
human life that went out a hundred years
ago, and study its works to know the man.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>I care not what his neighbors thought; I
care not for the idle gossip of an idle hour.
I know that his immortal songs were not
born of his wondrous brain alone, but of
the gentlest, trust, tenderest heart that ever
felt another’s pain. I know full well that
the love songs of Robert Burns could have
come from no one else than Robert Burns.
I know that even the Infinite could not
have changed the man and left the songs.
Burns, like all true poets, told us what he
felt and saw, and it is not for me to ask excuses
for this or that; but rather reverently
to bow my head in the presence of this great
memory, and thank the infinite source of
life for blessing us with Robert Burns exactly
as he was.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is difficult to understand our own being;
it is impossible to know our fellow
man’s, but I have faith to think that all life
is but a portion of one great inclusive power,
and that all is good and none is bad. The
true standard for judging Burns and all other
men is given by Carlyle, and I cannot refrain
from borrowing and adopting what he
says:</p>

<p class='c000'>“The world is habitually unjust in its judgments
of such men; unjust on many
grounds, of which this one may be stated as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>the substance: It decides, like a court of
law, by dead statutes; and not positively but
negatively, less on what is done right than
on what is or is not done wrong. Not the
few inches of deflection from the mathematical
orbit, which are so easily measured, but
the ratio of these to the whole diameter,
constitutes the real aberration. This orbit
may be a planet’s, its diameter the breadth
of the solar system; or it may be a city hippodrome;
nay, the circle of a ginhorse, its
diameter a score of feet or paces. But the
inches of deflection only are measured; and
it is assumed that the diameter of the ginhorse
and that of the planet will yield the
same ratio when compared with them!
Here lies the root of many a blind, cruel
condemnation of Burns, Swift, Rousseau,
which one never listens to with approval.
Granted, the ship comes into harbor with
shrouds and tackle damaged; the pilot is
blameworthy; he has not been all-wise and
all-powerful; but to know how blameworthy;
tell us first whether his voyage has been
around the Globe, or only to Ramsgate and
the Isle of Dogs.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Robert Burns has been dust for a hundred
years, and yet the world knows him better
now than the neighbors that lived beside his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>door. I look back upon the little village of
Dumfries,—not the first or the last town that
entertained angels unawares. I see poor
Robert Burns passing down the street, and
the pharisees and self-righteous walking on
the other side. The bill of indictment
brought against him by the Dumfries community
was long and black; he was intemperate,
immoral, irreligious, and disloyal to
the things that were. The first two would
doubtless have been forgiven, but the others
could not be condoned. And so this illustrious
man walked an outcast through the
town that to-day makes its proudest boast
that it holds the ashes of the mighty dead,
who in life was surrounded by such a halo of
glory that his neighbors could not see his
face.</p>

<p class='c000'>A hundred years ago Scotland was held
tightly in the grasp of the Presbyterian faith.
Calvinism is not very attractive even now,
especially to us that live and expect to die
outside its fold, but even Calvinism has softened
and changed in a hundred years.
Burns was too religious to believe in the
Presbyterian faith, and to the Scotch Covenanter
there was no religion outside the Calvinistic
creed. How any man can read the
poetry of Robert Burns and not feel the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>deep religious spirit that animates its lines
is more than I can see. True, he ridicules
the dogmas and the creeds that held the humanity
and intellect of Scotland in its paralyzing
grasp; but creeds and dogmas are
the work of man; they come and go; are
born and die; serve their time and pass
away; but the love of humanity, the instincts
of charity and tenderness, the deep
reverence felt in the presence of the infinite
mystery and power that pervade the universe,
these, the basis of all the religions of
the earth, remain forever, while creeds and
dogmas crumble to the dust.</p>

<p class='c000'>Scotland of a hundred years ago measured
Burns’ religion by “Holy Willie’s Prayer,”
“The Holy Fair,” and kindred songs. The
world a hundred years from now will not
make these the only test. Dumfries and all
the Unco’ Guid of Scotland could not forgive
Burns for writing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It was not enough that Robert Burns
taught a religion as pure and gentle and
loving as that proclaimed by the Nazarene
himself. Its meaning and beauty and charity
were lost on those who would not see.
Long ago it was written down that, “Inasmuch
as ye have done it unto one of the
least of these my brethren, ye have done it
unto me.” If this is any test of a religious
life, then few men will stand as high in the
great beyond as Robert Burns. This poor
poet has melted more hearts to pity and
moved more souls to mercy, and inclined
more lives to charity than any other poet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>that ever dreamed and sung. Not men and
women and children alone were the objects
of his bounteous love and tender heart, but
he felt the pain of the bird, the hare, the
mouse, and even the daisy whose roots were
upturned to the biting blast. Hear him
sing of the poor bird for whom he shudders
at the winter’s cold:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Ilka hopping bird, we helpless thing</div>
      <div class='line'>That in the merry month o’ spring</div>
      <div class='line'>Delighted me to hear thee sing,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>What comes o’ thee!</div>
      <div class='line'>Where wilt thou cow’r thy chilling wing</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And close thy ee?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Few men that ever lived would stop and
lament with Burns, as he shattered the poor
clay home of the field mouse with his
plough. No matter what he did; no matter
what he said; no matter what his creed; the
man that wrote these lines deserves a place
with the best and purest of this world or any
other that the Universe may hold.</p>

in inflicting pain with the inhuman gun and
rod, these lines written a hundred years ago,
on seeing a wounded hare limp by, should
place Burns amongst the blessed of the
earth:</p>

    <div class='group'>

      <div class='line'>The sober eve, or hail the cheerful dawn,</div>
      <div class='line'>I’ll miss thee sporting o’er the dewy lawn,</div>
      <div class='line'>And curse the ruffian’s aim, and mourn thy hapless fate.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>This was Robert Burns,—and yet Dumfries,
which held this gentle soul within its
walls, and the Protestant world of a hundred
years ago, looked at John Calvin piling the
faggots around Servetus’ form, and knelt
before him as a patron, religious saint, while
they cast into outer darkness poor Robert
Burns with his heart bowed down at the suffering
of a wounded hare.</p>

<p class='c000'>Will the world ever learn what true religion
is? Will it ever learn that mercy and
pity and charity are more in the sight of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>Infinite than all the creeds and dogmas of
the earth? Will it ever learn to believe this
beautiful verse of Robert Burns:</p>

Man is nature’s last and most
perfect work, but, however
high his development or
great his achievements, he is
yet a child of the earth and
the rude forces that have
formed all the life that exists
thereon. He cannot separate himself from
the environment that gave him birth, and a
thousand ties of nature bind him back to the
long forgotten past and prove his kinship to
all the lower forms of life that have sprung
from that great universal mother, Earth.</p>

<p class='c000'>As there is a common law of being, which
controls all living things, from the aimless
motions of the mollusk in the sea to the
most perfect conduct of the best developed
man, so all the activities of human life, from
the movements of the savage digging roots,
to the work of the greatest artist with his
brush, are controlled by universal law, and
are good or bad, perfect or imperfect, as
they conform to the highest condition nature
has imposed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The early savage dwelt in caves and cliffs
and spent his life in seeking food and providing
a rude shelter from the cold. He
looked upon the earth, the sun, the sea, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>sky, the mountain peak, the forest and the
plain, and all he saw and heard formed an
impression on his brain and aided in his
growth. Like a child he marveled at the
storm and flood; he stood in awe as he looked
upon disease and death; and to explain
the things he could not understand, he peopled
earth and air and sea with gods and demons,
and a thousand other weird creations
of his brain. All these mysterious creatures
were made in the image of the natural objects
that came within his view. The gods
were men grown large and endowed with
marvelous powers, while tree and bird and
beast alike were used as models for a being
greater far than any nature ever formed.</p>

<p class='c000'>An angry god it was that made the rivers
overrun their banks and leave destruction in
their path; an offended god it was that hurled
his thunderbolts upon a wicked world,
or sent disease and famine to the sinning
children of the earth: and to coax these
rulers to be merciful to man, the weak and
trembling children of the ancient world
turned their minds to sacrifice and prayer.
And the first clouded thoughts of these rude
men that were transcribed on monument
and stone, or carved in wood, or painted
with the colors borrowed from the sun and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>earth and sky; in short, the first rude art was
born to sing the praise, and tell the fame,
and paint the greatness of the gods. But all
of this was natural to the time and place; the
graven images, the chiseled hieroglyphics,
and all this rude beginning of literature and
art were formed upon what men saw and
heard and felt, enlarged and magnified to fit
the stature of the gods.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the world grew older art was used to
celebrate the greatness and achievements of
kings and rulers as well as gods, and their
tombs were ornamented with such decorations
as these early ages could create; and
yet all literature and art were only for the
gods and the rulers of the world. Then,
even more than now, wealth and power
brought intellect to do its will, and all its
force was spent to sing the praises of the
rulers of the earth and air. The basis of all
this art of pen and brush was the reality of
the world, but this was so magnified and
distorted for the base use of kings and
priests that realism, in the true sense, could
not exist. It would not do to paint a picture
of a king resembling a man of flesh and
blood, and of course a god must be far
greater than a king. It would not do to
write a tale in which kings and princes, lords
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>and ladies, should act like men and women,
else what difference between the ruler and
the ruled? The marvelous powers that romance
and myth had given to gods and
angels were transferred to those of royal
blood. The wonderful achievements of
these kings and princes could be equaled
only by the gods, and the poor dependents
of the world, who lived for the glory of the
great, were fed with legends and with tales
that sung the praises of the strong.</p>

<p class='c000'>Literature, sculpture, painting, music, and
architecture, indeed all forms of art, were
the exclusive property of the great, and the
artist then, like most of those to-day, was
retained to serve the strong and maintain the
status of the weak. No one dreamed that
there was any beauty in a common human
life or any romance in a fact. The greatest
of the earth had not yet learned to know
that every life is a mystery and every death
a tragedy; that the spark of the infinite,
which alone transforms clay to life, animates
alike the breast of the peasant and the soul
of the prince. The world had not yet
learned that the ant-hill is as great as Mont
Blanc, and the blade of grass as mysterious
as the oak. It is only now that the world is
growing so delicate and refined that it can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>see the beauty of a fact; that it is developing
a taste so rare as to distinguish between
the false and true; that it can be moved by
the gentle breeze as well as by the winter’s
gale; that it can see greater beauty in a
statement true to life, than in the inflated
tales, which children read.</p>

<p class='c000'>Most of the art and literature the world
has known has been untrue. The pictures
of the past have been painted from the distorted
minds of visionists, and the pliant
brains of tools. They have represented impossible
gods and unthinkable saints; angels
and cherubs and demons; everything but
men and women. Saints may be all right
in their place, but a saint with a halo around
his head was born of myth and not of art.
Angels may be well enough, but all rational
men prefer an angel with arms to an angel
with wings. When these artists were not
drawing saints and madonnas, they were
spending their time in painting kings and
royal knaves; and the pictures of the rulers
were as unlike the men and women that
they were said to represent as the servile
spirit of the painter was unlike that of the
true artist of to-day. Of course an artist
would not paint the poor; they had no
clothes that would adorn a work of art, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>no money nor favors that could remunerate
the toil. An ancient artist could no more
afford to serve the poor than a modern lawyer
could defend the weak.</p>

<p class='c000'>After literature had so far advanced as to
concern other beings than gods and kings,
the authors of these ancient days told of
wondrous characters endowed with marvelous
powers; knights with giant strength and
magic swords; princes with wondrous palaces
and heaps of gold; travelers that met
marvelous beasts and slew them in extraordinary
ways; giants with forms like mountains,
and strength like oxen, who could
vanquish all but little dwarfs. Railroads
were not invented in those early days,
but travel was facilitated by the use of seven
league boots. Balloons and telescopes were
not yet known, but this did not keep favored
heroes from peering at the stars or looking
down from on high upon the earth; they
had but to plant a magic bean before they
went to bed at night, and in the morning it
had grown so tall that it reached up to the
sky; and the hero, although not skilled in
climbing, needed simply to grasp the stalk
and say, “Hitchety, hatchety, up I go.
Hitchety, hatchety, up I go,” and by this
means soon vanish in the clouds. Tales of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>sort used once to delight the world, and the
readers half believed them true. We give
them to children now, and the best of these
view them with a half contempt.</p>

<p class='c000'>The modern man does not enjoy these
myths. He relishes a lie, but it must not be
too big; it must be so small that, although
he knows in his inmost soul that it is not
true, he can yet half make himself believe
it is not false. Most of us have cherished a
pleasing, waking dream, and have fondly
clung to the sweet delusion while we really
knew it was not life. The modern literary
stomach is becoming so healthy that it wants
a story at least half true; should the falsehood
be too strong, it acts as an emetic instead
of food. These old fairy tales have
lost their power to charm, as the stories of
the gods and kings went down before. They
have lost their charm, for as we read them
now, they wake no answering chord born of
the experiences that make up what we know
of human life.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the beauty of realism shall be truly
known, we shall read the book, or look upon
the work of art, and in the light of all
we know of life, shall ask our beings
whether the picture that the author or the
painter creates for us is like the image that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>is born of the consciousness that moves our
soul, and the experiences that have made
us know.</p>

<p class='c000'>Realism worships at the shrine of nature;
it does not say that there may not be a
sphere in which beings higher than man
can live, or that some time an eye may not
rest upon a fairer sunset than was ever born
behind the clouds and sea, but it knows
that through countless ages nature has slowly
fitted the brain and eye of man to the
earth on which we live and the objects that
we see: and the perfect earthly eye must
harmonize with the perfect earthly scene.</p>

<p class='c000'>To say that realism is coarse and vulgar is
to declare against nature and her works, and
to assert that the man she made may dream
of things higher and grander than nature
could unfold. The eye of the great sculptor
reveals to him the lines that make the most
perfect human form, and he chisels out the
marble block until it resembles this image
so completely that it almost seems to live.
Nature, through ages of experiment and development,
has made this almost faultless
form. It is perfect because every part is
best fitted for the separate work it has to do.
The artist knows that he could not improve
a single organ if he would, for all the rest of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>nature must be adjusted to the change. He
has the skill to reproduce this shape in lasting
stone, and the human brain could not conceive
a form more beautiful and fair. Here
is a perfect image of the highest work that
countless centuries of nature’s toil has made,
and yet some would seek to beautify and
sanctify this work by dressing it in the garb
that shifting fashion and changing fancy
makes for man.</p>

<p class='c000'>Only the vulgar superstition of the past
ever suggested that the reproduction of human
forms in stone was an unholy work.
Through long dark centuries religion taught
that the flesh was vile and bad, and that the
soul of man was imprisoned in a charnel
house, unfit for human sight. The early
Christians wounded, bruised, and maimed
their house of clay; they covered it with
skins, which under no circumstances could
be removed, and many ancient saints lived
and died without ever having looked upon
the bodies nature gave. The images of
saints and martyrs, which in the name of
religion were scattered through Europe,
were covered with paint and clothes, and
were nearly as hideous as the monks that
placed them there. When the condition of
Europe and its religious thought are clearly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>understood, it is not difficult to imagine the
reception that greeted the first dawn of modern
realistic art. Sculpture and painting deified
the material. They told of beauty in
the human form which hundreds of years
of religious fanaticism had taught was bad
and vile. If the flesh was beautiful, what of
the monks and priests, who had hidden it
from sight, who had kept it covered night
and day through all their foolish lives, who
maimed and bruised, cut and lacerated, for
the glory of the spirit, which they thought
was chained within. The church had taught
that the death of the flesh was the birth of
the soul, and they therefore believed that
the artist’s resurrection of the flesh was the
death of the soul.</p>

<p class='c000'>This old religious prejudice, born of a
misty, superstitious past, has slowly faded
from the minds of men, but we find its
traces even yet. The origin of the feeling
against realistic art has well nigh been forgot,
but much of the feeling still remains.
No one would now pretend to say that all
the body was unholy or unfit for sight,
and yet years of custom and inherited belief
have made us think that a part is good and
the rest is bad: that nature, in her work of
building up the human form, has made one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>part sacred and another vile. It is easy to
mistake custom for nature, and inherited prejudice
for morality. There is scarcely a single
portion of the human body but that some
people have thought it holy, and scarcely a
single portion but that some have believed it
vile. It was not shame that made clothing,
but clothing that made shame. If we would
eradicate from our beliefs all that inheritance
and environment have given, it would be
hard for us to guess how much should still
remain. Custom has made most things good
and most things bad, according to the whim
of time and place. To find solid ground we
must turn to nature and ask her what it is
that conduces to the highest happiness and
the longest life.</p>

<p class='c000'>The realistic artist cannot accept the popular
belief, whatever that may be, as to just
where the dead line on the human body
should be drawn that separates the sacred
and profane. There are realists that look at
all the beauty and loveliness of the world,
and all its maladjustments too, and do not
seek to answer the old, old question whether
back of this is any all-controlling and designing
power; they do not answer, for they
cannot know; but they strive to touch the
subtle chord that makes their individual lives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>vibrate in harmony with the great heart of
that nature, which they love; and they cannot
think but that all parts of life are good,
and that while men may differ, nature must
know best.</p>

<p class='c000'>Other realists there are that believe they
see in nature the work of a divine maker,
who created man in his own image as the
last and highest triumph of his skill; that the
minutest portion of the universe exists because
he wished it thus. To the realist that
accepts this all-controlling power, any imputation
against a portion of his master’s
work must reach back to the author that designed
it all.</p>

<p class='c000'>We need not say that the human body
might not be better than it is; we need only
know that it is the best that man can have,
and that its wondrous mechanism has been
constructed with infinitely more than human
skill; that every portion is adapted for
its work, and through the harmony of every
part the highest good is reached; and that
all is beautiful, for it makes the being best
adapted to the earth. Those who denounce
realistic art deny that knowledge is power
and that wisdom only can make harmony,
and they insist instead that there are some
things vital to life and happiness that we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>should not know, but that if we must know
these things, we should at all events pretend
that we do not. One day the world will
learn that all things are good or bad according
to the service they perform. One day
it ought to learn that the power to create
immortality, through infinite succeeding
links of human life, is the finest and most
terrible that nature ever gave to man, and
that to ignore this power or call it bad, or
fail to realize the great responsibility of this
tremendous fact, is to cry out against the
power that gave us life, and commit the
greatest human sin, for it may be one that
never dies.</p>

<p class='c000'>The true artist does not find all beauty in
the human face or form. He looks upon
the sunset, painting all the clouds with rosy
hue, and his highest wish is to create another
scene like this. He never dreams
that he could paint a sunset fairer than the
one which lights the fading world. A fairer
sunset would be something else. He sees
beauty in the quiet lake, the grassy field,
and running brook; he sees majesty in the
cataract and mountain peak. He knows
that he can paint no streams and mountain
peaks more perfect than the ones that
nature made.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>The growth of letters has been like the
growth of art from the marvelous and mythical
to the natural and true. The tales and
legends of the ancient past were not of common
men and common scenes. These
could not impress the undeveloped intellect
of long ago. A man of letters could not
deify a serf, or tell the simple story of the
poor. He must write to maintain the status
of the world, and please the prince that gave
him food; so he told of kings and queens,
of knights and ladies, of strife and conquest;
and the coloring he used was human blood.</p>

<p class='c000'>The world has grown accustomed to those
ancient tales, to scenes of blood and war,
and novels that would thrill the soul and
cause the hair to stand on end. It has read
these tales so long that the true seems commonplace,
and unfit to fill the pages of a
book. But all the time we forget the fact
that the story could not charm unless we
half believed it true. The men and women
in the tale we learn to love and hate; we
take an interest in their lives; we hope they
may succeed or fail; we must not be told at
every page that the people of the book are
men of straw, that no such beings ever lived
upon the earth. We could take no interest
in men and women that are myths conjured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>up to play their parts, and remind us in
every word they speak that, regardless of the
happiness or anguish the author makes them
feel, they are but myths and can know
neither joy nor pain.</p>

<p class='c000'>It may be that the realistic tale is commonplace,
but so is life, and the realistic tale is
true. Among the countless millions of the
earth it is only here and there, and now and
then, that some soul is born from out the
mighty deep that does not soon return to
the great sea and leave no ripple on the
waves.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the play of life each actor seems important
to himself; the world he knows revolves
around him as the central figure of
the scene; his friends rejoice in all the fortune
he attains and weep with him in all his
grief. To him the world is bounded by the
faces that he knows, and the scenes in which
he lives. He forgets the great surging world
outside, and cannot think how small a space
he fills in that infinity which bounds his life.
He dies, and a few sorrowing friends mourn
him for a day, and the world does not know
he ever lived or ever died. In the ordinary
life nearly all events are commonplace; but
a few important days are thinly sprinkled in
amongst all of those that intervene between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>the cradle and the grave. We eat and drink,
we work and sleep, and here and there a
great joy or sorrow creeps in upon our lives,
and leaves a day that stands out against the
monotony of all the rest, like the pyramids
upon the level plains; but these events are
very few and are important only to ourselves,
and for the rest we walk with steady pace
and slow along the short and narrow path of
life, and rely upon the common things alone
to occupy our minds and hide from view the
marble stone that here and there gleams
through the over-hanging trees just where
the road leaves off.</p>

<p class='c000'>The old novel which we used to read and
to which the world so fondly clings, had no
idea of relation or perspective. It had a
hero and a heroine, and sometimes more
than one. The revolutions of the planets
were less important than their love. War,
shipwreck, and conflagration, all conspired
to produce the climax of the scene, and the
whole world stood still until the lovers’
hearts and hands were joined. Wide oceans,
burning deserts, arctic seas, impassable
jungles, irate fathers, and even designing
mothers, were helpless against the decree
that fate had made, and when all the barriers
were passed and love had triumphed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>over impossibilities, the tale was done;
through the rest of life nothing of interest
could occur. Sometimes in the progress of
the story, if the complications were too great,
a thunderbolt or an earthquake was introduced
to destroy the villain and help on the
match. Earthquakes sometimes happen,
and the realistic novelist might write a tale
of a scene like this, but then the love affair
would be an incident of the earthquake, and
not the earthquake an incident of the love
affair.</p>

<p class='c000'>In real life the affections have played an
important part and sometimes great things
have been done and suffered in the name of
love, but most of the affairs of the human
heart have been as natural as the other
events of life.</p>

<p class='c000'>The true love story is generally a simple
thing. “Beside a country road, on a sloping
hill, lives a farmer, in the house his
father owned before. He has a daughter,
who skims the milk, and makes the beds, and
goes to singing school at night. There are
other members of the household, but our
tale is no concern of theirs. In the meadow
back of the house a woodchuck has dug its
hole, and reared a family in its humble
home. Across the valley only a mile away,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>another farmer lives. He has a son, who
plows the fields and does the chores and
goes to singing school at night. He cannot
sing, but attends the school as regularly as
if he could. Of course he does not let the
girl go home alone, and in the spring, when
singing school is out, he visits her on Sunday
eve without excuse. If the girl had not lived
so near, the boy would have fancied another
girl about the same age, who also went to
singing school. Back of the second farmer’s
house is another woodchuck hole and woodchuck
home. After a year or two of courtship
the boy and girl are married as their
parents were before, and they choose a pretty
spot beside the road, and build another
house near by, and settle down to common
life: and so the world moves on. And a
woodchuck on one farm meets a woodchuck
on the other, and they choose a quiet place
beside a stump, in no one’s way, where they
think they have a right to be, and dig
another hole and make another home.”
For after all, men and animals are much
alike, and nature loves them both and loves
them all, and sends them forth to drive the
loneliness from off the earth, and then takes
them back into her loving breast to sleep.</p>

<p class='c000'>It may be that there are few great incidents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>in the realistic take, but each event appeals
to life and cannot fail to wake our memories
and make us live the past again. The
great authors of the natural school—Tolstoi,
Hardy, Howells, Daudet, Ibsen, Flaubert,
Zola and their kind, have made us think and
live. Their words have burnished up our
minds and revealed a thousand pictures that
hang upon the walls of memory, covered
with the dust of years, and hidden from our
sight. Sometimes of course we cry with
pain at the picture that is thrown before our
view, but life consists of emotions, and we
cannot truly live unless the depths are
stirred. These great masters, it is true, may
sometimes shock the over-sensitive with the
tales they tell of life, but if the tale is true,
why hide it from our sight?</p>

<p class='c000'>There is nothing more common than the
protest against the wicked stories of the realistic
school, filled with tales of passion and
of sin; but he that denies passion denies all
the life that exists upon the earth, and cries
out against the mother that gave him birth.
And he that ignores this truth passes with
contempt the greatest fact that nature has
impressed upon the world. Those who condemn
as sensual the tales of Tolstoi and
Daudet still defend the love stories of which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>our literature is full. Those weak and silly
tales that make women fit only to be the
playthings of the world, and deny to them
a single thought or right except to serve
their master, man. These objectors do not
contend that tales dealing with the feelings
and affections shall not be told, they approve
these tales; they simply insist that they shall
be false instead of true. The old novel filled
the mind of the school girl with a thousand
thoughts that had no place in life—with ten
thousand pictures she could never see. It
taught that some time she should meet a
prince in disguise to whom she would freely
give her hand and heart. So she went out
upon the road to find this prince, and the
more disguised he was, the more certain
did she feel that he was the prince for whom
she sought. The realist paints the passions
and affections as they are. Both man and
woman can see their beauty and their terror,
their true position, and the relation that
they bear to all the rest of life. He would
not beguile the girl into the belief that
her identity should be destroyed and merged
for the sake of this feeling, which not
once in ten thousand times could realize
the promises the novel made; but he
would leave her as an individual to make the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>most she can, and all she can, of life, with
all the hope and chance of conquest, which
men have taken for themselves. Neither
would the realist cry out blindly against these
deep passions, which have moved men and
women in the past, and which must continue
fierce and strong as long as life exists. He
is taught by the scientist that the fiercest
heat may be transformed to light, and is
taught by life that from the strongest passions
are sometimes born the sweetest and the
purest souls.</p>

<p class='c000'>In these days of creeds and theories, of
preachers in the pulpit and of preachers out,
we are told that all novels should have a
moral and be written to serve some end.
So we have novels on religion, war, marriage,
divorce, socialism, theosophy, woman’s
rights, and other topics without end. It is
not enough that the preachers and lecturers
shall tell us how to think and act; the novelist
must try his hand at preaching too. He
starts out with a theory, and every scene and
incident must be bent to make it plain that
the author believes certain things. The doings
of the men and women in the book are
secondary to the views the author holds.
The theories may be true, but the poor characters
that must adjust their lives to these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>ideal states are sadly warped and twisted out
of shape. The realist would teach a lesson,
too, but he would not violate a single fact
for all the theories in the world—for a theory
could not be true if it did violence to life.
He paints his picture so true and perfect that
all men who look upon it know it is a likeness
of the world that they have seen; they
know that these are men and women and
little children that they meet upon the streets;
they see the conditions of their lives, and the
moral of the picture sinks deep into their
minds.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are so-called scientists that make a
theory and then gather facts to prove their
theory true; the real scientist patiently and
impartially gathers facts, and then forms a
theory to explain and harmonize these facts.
All life bears a moral, and the true artist
must teach a lesson with his every fact. Some
contend that the moral teacher must not tell
the truth; the realist holds that there can be
no moral teaching like the truth. The
world has grown tired of preachers and sermons;
to-day it asks for facts. It has grown
tired of fairies and angels, and asks for flesh
and blood. It looks on life as it exists, both
its beauty and its horror, its joy and its sorrow;
it wishes to see it all; not the prince
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>and the millionaire alone, but the laborer
and the beggar, the master and the slave.
We see the beautiful and the ugly, and with
it know what the world is and what it ought
to be; and the true picture, which the author
saw and painted, stirs the heart to holier feelings
and to grander thoughts.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is from the realities of life that the highest
idealities are born. The philosopher
may reason with unerring logic, and show us
where the world is wrong. The economist
may tell us of the progress and poverty that
go hand in hand; but these are theories, and
the abstract cannot suffer pain. Dickens
went out into the streets of the great city
and found poor little Jo sweeping the crossing
with his broom. All around was the
luxury and the elegance, which the rich have
ever appropriated to themselves; great mansions,
fine carriages, beautiful dresses, but in
all the great city of houses and homes, poor
little Jo could find no place to lay his head.
His home was in the street, and every time
he halted for a moment in the throng, the
policeman touched him with his club and
bade him “move on.” At last, ragged,
wretched, almost dead with “moving on,”
he sank down upon the cold stone steps of a
magnificent building erected for “The Propagation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>of the Gospel in Foreign Parts.”
As we think of wretched, ragged Jo in the
midst of all this luxury and wealth, we see
the tens of thousands of other waifs in the
great cities of the world, and we condemn
the so-called civilization of the earth that
builds the mansions of the rich and great
upon the rags and miseries of the poor.</p>

<p class='c000'>The true realist cannot worship at the
shrine of power, nor prostitute his gifts for
gold. With an artist’s eye he sees the world
exactly as it is, and tells the story faithful
unto life. He feels for every heart that
beats, else he could not paint them as he
does. It takes the soul to warm a statue into
life and make living flesh and coursing
blood, and each true picture that he paints
or draws makes the world a better place in
which to live.</p>

<p class='c000'>The artists of the realistic school have a
sense so fine that they cannot help but catch
the inspiration that is filling all the world’s
best minds with the hope of greater justice
and more equal social life. With the vision
of the seer they feel the coming dawn when
true equality shall reign upon the earth; the
time when democracy shall no more be confined
to constitutions and to laws, but will be
a part of human life. The greatest artists
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>of the world to-day are telling facts and
painting scenes that cause humanity to stop,
and think, and ask why one should be a
master and another be a serf; why a portion
of the world should toil and spin, should
wear away its strength and life, that the rest
should live in idleness and ease.</p>

<p class='c000'>The old-time artists thought they served
humanity by painting saints and madonnas
and angels from the myths they conjured in
their brains. They painted war with long
lines of soldiers dressed in uniforms, and
looking plump and gay; and a battle scene
was always drawn from the side of the victorious
camp, with the ensign proudly planting
his bright colors on the rampart of the
foe. One or two were dying, but always in
their comrades’ arms, and listening to shouts
of victory that filled the air, and thinking of
the righteous cause for which they fought
and died. In the last moments they dreamed
of pleasant burial yards at home, and of
graves kept green by loving, grateful friends;
and a smile of joy shone on their wasted
faces that was so sweet, that it seemed a hardship
not to die in war. They painted peace
as a white winged dove settling down upon
a cold and fading earth. Between the two
it was plain which choice a boy would make,
and thus art served the state and king.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>But Verestchagin painted war; he painted
war so true to life that as we look upon the
scene, we long for peace. He painted war
as war has ever been, and as war will ever
be—a horrible and ghastly scene, where
men, drunk with blind frenzy which rulers
say is patriotic pride, and made mad by
drums and fifes and smoke and shot and
shell and flowing blood, seek to maim and
wound and kill, because a ruler gives the
word. He paints a battle field, a field of life
and death; a field of carnage and of blood;
and who are these that fight like fiends and
devils driven to despair? What cause is
this that makes these men forget that they
are men, and vie with beasts to show their
cruel thirst for blood? They shout of home
and native land, but they have no homes,
and the owners of their native land exist
upon their toil and blood. The nobles and
princes, for whom this fight is waged, are
far away upon a hill, beyond the reach of
shot and shell, and from this spot they watch
their slaves pour out their blood to satisfy
their rulers’ pride and lust of power. What
is the enemy they fight? Men like themselves;
who blindly go to death at another
king’s command, slaves, who have no land,
who freely give their toil or blood, whichever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>one their rulers may demand. These
fighting soldiers have no cause for strife,
but their rulers live by kindling in their
hearts a love of native land, a love that
makes them hate their brother laborers of
other lands, and dumbly march to death to
satisfy a king’s caprice. But let us look
once more after the battle has been fought.
Here we see the wreck and ruin of the strife;
the field is silent now, given to the dead,
the beast of prey and night. A young soldier
lies upon the ground; the snow is falling
fast around his form; the lonely mountain
peaks rise up on every side; the wreck of
war is all about. His uniform is soiled and
stained, a spot of red is seen upon his breast.
It is not the color that his country wove
upon his coat to catch his eye and bait him
to his death; it is hard and jagged and cold.
It is his life’s blood, which leaked out
through a hole that followed the point of a
sabre to his heart. His form is stiff and
cold, for he is dead. The cruel wound and
icy air have done their work. The government
that took his life taught this poor boy
to love his native land; as a child he dreamed
of scenes of glory and of power, and the
great wide world just waiting to fall captive
to his magic strength. He dreamed of war
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>and strife, of victory and fame; if he should
die, kind hands would smooth his brow, and
loving friends would keep his grave and
memory green, because he died in war. But
no human eye is there at last, as the mist of
night and mist of death shut out the lonely
mountains from his sight. The snow is all
around, and the air above is grey with falling
flakes, which soon will hide him from the
world; and when the summer time shall
come again, no one can tell his bleaching
bones from all the rest. The only life upon
the scene is the buzzard slowly circling in
the air above his head, waiting to make sure
that death has come. The bird looks down
upon the boy, into the eyes through which
he first looked out upon the great, wide
world, and which his mother fondly kissed;
upon these eyes the buzzard will commence
his meal.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not all the world is beautiful, and not all
of life is good. The true artist has no right
to choose the lovely spots alone and make
us think that this is life. He must bring the
world before our eyes and make us read and
learn. As he loves the true and noble, he
must show the false and bad. As he yearns
for true equality, he must paint the master
and the slave. He must tell the truth, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>tell it all, must tell it o’er and o’er again, till
the deafest ear will listen and the dullest
mind will think. He must not swerve to
please the world by painting only pleasant
sights and telling only lovely tales. He
must think, and paint, and write, and work,
until the world shall learn so much and grow
so good, that the true will all be beautiful
and all the real be ideal.</p>

The closet has so long been
allotted to the skeleton that
we have come to regard this
room as its fit and natural
home; it has been given over
to this guest because it is the
darkest, the closest and least
conspicuous in the house. The door can be
securely fastened and only now and then can
the grating bones be heard by the world
outside. Still, however secluded and unused
this guest chamber seems to be, and however
carefully we bolt the door and darken
every chink and crevice in the walls, we are
ever conscious that the occupant is there,
and will remain until the house is closed,
and the last tenant has departed, never to
return. The very fact that we try so hard
to keep the skeleton in its proper room,
makes it the more impossible to forget that
it is there. Now and then we awake with a
start at the thought of what might happen
should it break the door and wander through
the house, and then stray out into the wide
world, and tell all the peaceful, trusting
neighbors from what house it stole away;
and yet we are somehow conscious that the
rumor of its dread presence has already
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>traveled as far as we are known. Man is a
wonderfully adaptable animal; he fits himself
easily into the environment where he is
placed. He passes from infancy to childhood
and from childhood to boyhood as
smoothly as the placid river flows to the
waiting sea. Every circumstance and surrounding
of his life seems to have been made
for him. Suddenly a new desire takes possession
of his soul; he turns his back on the
home of his childhood days and goes out
alone. In a little time a new family is reared
about him, and he forgets the group that
clustered round his father’s hearth. He
may lose a leg or a fortune, and he soon
conforms to his changed condition and life
goes on as naturally and as easily as before.
A child is born beneath his roof; it takes a
place within his heart and home, and in a
little while he can scarcely think of the day
it was not there. Death comes, and a member
of his little band is carried out, but time
drops its healing balm upon the wounds and
life goes on almost unconscious that the
dead has ever lived. But while we adjust
ourselves naturally to all things living and to
ever varying scenes, the skeleton in the
closet is always an intruder, no matter how
long it may have dwelt beneath the roof.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>Even though we may forget its actual presence
for a little time, still no scene is so perfect
and no enjoyment so great but we feel
a cloud casting its shadow across our happiness
or the weight of some burden on our
soul; and when we stop to ask the cause,
the grinning skeleton reminds us that it is
with us even here.</p>

<p class='c000'>This specter stands quite apart from the
other sorrows of our life; age seems powerless
to forget, and time will not bring its
ever-fresh, recurring scenes to erase the
memory of the past. This is not because
the skeleton is really such a dreadful guest.
The kind and loving ivy creeps tenderly
around each yawning scar and crumbling
stone, until the whole ruin is covered with
a lovely green. The decaying pile stands
free and open to the sun and rain and air.
It does not hide its head or apologize for
the blemishes and seams that mark its face,
and a kind, forgiving nature takes the ruin,
scars and all, and blends these with her
softening years and lovely face into a beautiful
harmonious whole; but unlike the ruin,
the skeleton in the closet is a neglected,
outcast child. With every breath we insist
that there is nothing in the room. We refuse
to take it to our hearts and homes and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>acknowledge it as our own. We seek to
strangle it to death, and each fresh attempt
not only shows our murderous design, but
proves that the skeleton is not a pulseless
thing but is endowed with immortal life.
The brighter the fire-light that glows around
our hearth, the more desolate and drear
sounds the wail of the wind outside, for
through its cold blasts wanders the outcast,
whose rightful place is in the brightest corner
of the room.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our constant annoyance and sorrow at this
dread presence is not caused by the way the
skeleton behaves to us, but from the way we
treat our guest. If we looked it squarely in
its grinning skull, it might not seem so very
loathsome to the sight. It has the right to
grin. It may be but a grim smile over the
consciousness that it has sounded the last
sorrow and that henceforth no greater evils
are in store; it may be a mocking, sardonic
grin at the thought of our discomfiture over
its unwelcome presence and the knowledge
that we cannot drive it out.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is no truer index to real character
than the way we treat the skeletons with
which we live. Some run to the closet door,
and try to lock it fast when a neighbor comes
their way. If perchance any fear of discovery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>is felt, they stand guard outside and
solemnly protest that there is nothing in the
room. Their anxiety and haste plainly show
fear lest their hated guest shall reveal its
face; and of course there rises in the neighbor’s
mind a vision of a skeleton more horrible
by far than the one inside the door or
than anyone can be. If the luckless jailer
really fears that the rattle of the prisoner’s
bones has been heard outside, he feels it his
duty to carefully explain or tediously cover
up every detail and circumstance that caused
the presence of the specter in the house.
All this can only show that the guest is terrible
to behold or that the jailer is so poor
and weak that he himself is a helpless
prisoner to his foolish pride and unmanly
fear. It can only serve to emphasize the
presence he tries so vainly to deny. There
are also those who know that their skeleton
has been seen, or who having lost all else
but this persistent, grinning guest, drag it
out and parade it in the world to gain the
sympathy or the money of their neighbors and
their friends, like the crippled beggar standing
on the corner holding out his hat to every
passer-by. The true man neither guiltily
conceals nor anxiously explains nor vulgarly
parades. He lives his life the best he can,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>and lets it stand for what it is. A thousand
idle tales may be true or false. One may
have seen but certain things, and placed
him with the saints. Another little soul,
who never felt the breadth and depth of human
life, may have seen his scars alone, and
cast him out. But standing by his side, or
clasping his strong, sympathetic hand, no
one thinks of halos or scars or asks an explanation
of this or that, for in his whole
being is felt the divine presence of a great
soul, who has lived and loved, sinned and
suffered, and been strengthened and purified
by all.</p>

<p class='c000'>The skeleton is really kind that it only
grins as we look it in the face. Of all our
household it has received the hardest treatment
at our hands. It has helped us more
than any of the rest, and been locked in the
closet for its pains. It may perchance have
come at our own invitation, bringing us the
keenest, wildest joy our life had ever known.
We gladly drained the pleasure to the dregs,
and then coolly locked the memory close in
the darkest hole that we could find. The day
it came, has well nigh faded from our minds,
and the mad, wild joy we knew can never
more be wakened from the burned-out passions
of the past, but the skeleton, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>rose up grim and ghastly from the dying
flame, remains to mock and jeer and make
us sad. And now when the day is spent and
the cup is drained, we charge the poor
specter with our lasting pain, and forget the
joy it brought. We look with dread at these
mocking, grinning bones, which we cannot
drive away, and we forget the time, long,
long ago, when those dry sticks were covered
up with beautiful and tempting flesh.</p>

<p class='c000'>It may be that we shall always shudder as
we hear the rattle of the bones when we
pass the closet door, but in justice to the inmate,
we should give him credit for the joys
of long ago. And this brings us back to the
old question of the balancing of pain and
pleasure, good and evil, right and wrong.
It may be that in the mysterious adjustment
of nature’s balances, a moment of supreme
bliss will outweigh an eternity of pain. In
the infinite economy, which life counted for
the more,—that of Napoleon, or the poor
French peasant that passed through an obscure
existence to an unknown grave? The
brief glory of Austerlitz was followed by the
bitterness of Waterloo, and the long silence
of an exile’s life, while the peasant trod his
short path without ambition, and filled a
nameless grave without regret. Which is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>the greater and finer, the blameless life of
the patient brute, or the winding, devious
path of a human soul? It is only the dull
level that brings no sorrow or regret. It is
a sterile soil where no weeds will grow, and
a bare closet where no skeleton will dwell.</p>

<p class='c000'>Neither should we remember the skeleton
only for the joy it brought; from the day it
came, it has been the greatest benefactor that
our life has known. When the mad delirium
had passed away, and the last lingering fragrance
was almost spent, this despised skeleton
remained as the sole companion, whose
presence should forever bind us back to those
feelings that were fresh and true and straight
from nature’s heart, and that world which
once was green and young and filled with
pulsing life. As the shadows gather round
our head, and our once-straying feet fall mechanically
into the narrow path so straight
and even at the farther end, we may shudder
now and then at the thought of the grim
skeleton whose life is so far removed from
our sober later selves; but with the shudder
comes a spark, a flash of that great, natural
light and heat that once possessed this tottering
frame, and gave a glow of feeling and a
strength of purpose so deep and all-controlling
that the artificial life of an artificial world
seems no more than a dim candle shining
by the glorious sun.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>It is the exhausted emotions of age, which
men call prudence, that are ever warning
youth of the follies of its sins. It is the grinning
skeleton, speaking truly from the memory
of other days, that insists that life’s morning
held the halcyon hours. Does old age
outlive the follies of childhood or does the
man outgrow the wisdom of youth? The
most vociferous preachers are often those
whose natural spirits have led them to drink
the deepest of life. They are so foolish as
to think that others can be taught by their
experiences, and mumbling grey-beards endorse
the excellence and wisdom of the sermons
that they preach. They are not wise
enough to know that their prattle is more
vain and foolish than the babblings of their
childhood days. It was the growing, vital
sap of life that made them children years
ago; it is the icy, palsying touch of age that
makes them babbling, preaching children
once again. As well might the calm and
placid lake teach the beauty of repose to the
boiling, seething cataract, that thunders down
Niagara’s gulf. When the troubled waters
shall have reached the lake they shall be
placid too. Nature is wiser far than man.
She makes the first childhood precede the
second. If the age of prudence came with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>youth, it would be a dull and prosy world
for a little time; then life would be extinct
upon the earth and death triumphant over
all.</p>

<p class='c000'>But these are the smallest reasons why we
should venerate the neglected skeleton,
which we have ruthlessly cast into the closet
as if it were a hideous thing. This uncanny
skeleton, ever thrusting its unwelcome bones
into our presence and our lives, has been the
most patient, persistent, constant teacher
that all our years have known. We look
backward through the long dim vista of the
past, back to the little trusting child that
once nestled on its mother’s breast and from
whose loving lips and gentle soul it first was
told of life, its temptations and its sins;
backward to her, whose whole thought was
a benediction to the life that was once a portion
of herself. We remember still this
mother’s words teaching us the way to live
and telling us the way to die. We always
knew that no selfish thought inspired a
single word she said and yet time and time
again we strayed and wandered from the
path she pointed out. We could not keep
the road and after while we did not try.
Again our teacher told us of the path. He,
too, was good and kind and knew the way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>we ought to go, and showed us all the bad
results of sin, and still we stumbled on. The
preacher came and told us of the beauteous
heaven, straight at the other end of the narrow
path, and the yawning gulf of hell to
which our shifting footsteps led; but we
heeded not his solemn tones, though they
seemed to come with the authority of God
himself. As the years went on, our mother’s
voice was stilled, the teacher’s words were
hushed, the preacher’s threats became an
empty, hollow sound; and in their place
came the grinning skeleton, born of our own
desires and deeds; less loving than the gentle
mother, more real and life-like than the
teacher, saner and truer than the preacher’s
idle words. It was ever present and persistent;
it was a portion of our very selves.</p>

<p class='c000'>We detested and feared the hated thing;
we locked it in the closet, and denied that it
was there; but through the brightness of the
day and the long and silent watches of the
night, we heard its rattling bones, and felt its
presence at our side. No teacher of our
youth was like that grim and ghastly skeleton,
which we tried to hide away. The
schoolmaster of our early life took our fresh,
young, plastic minds and sought to crowd
them full of useless, unrelated facts that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>served no purpose through the years that
were to come. These lessons that our
teacher made us learn by rote filled so small
a portion of our daily lives that most of them
were forgotten when the school-house door
was closed. When now and then we found
some use for a trifling thing that we had
learned through years at school, we were
surprised to know that the pedagogue had
taught us even this. In those early days it
seemed to us that life would consist of one
long examination in which we should be
asked the names of states, the rule of three,
and the words the Romans used for this and
that. All that we were taught of the great
world outside and the problem that would
one day try our souls, was learned from the
copy books where we wrote the same old
maxim until all the paper was used up. In
after years, we learned that, while the copy
book might have taught us how to write in
a stilted, unused hand, still all its maxims
were untrue.</p>

<p class='c000'>We left the school as ignorant of life as we
commenced, nay, we might more easily have
learned its lesson without the false, misleading
theories we were taught were true. When
the doors were opened and the wide world
met us face to face, we tested what we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>learned, and found it false, and then we
blundered on alone. We were taught by life
that the fire and vigor of our younger years
could not be governed by the platitudes of
age. Nature was ever present with her
strong and earthly grasp, her keen desires,
her white hot flame. We learned the precepts
of the books, but we lived the life that
nature taught.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our pathetic blunders and mistakes, and
the skeleton that followed in their wake, remained
to teach us what was false and point
to what was true. This grim, persistent
teacher made but little of the unimportant
facts that the schoolmaster sought to make
us learn, and it laughed to scorn the preacher’s
doctrine, that in some way we could
avoid the results of our mistakes and sins.
It did not preach, it took its place beside us
as another self and by its presence sought
to make us know that we could not be at
peace until we clasped it to our breast and
freely accepted the unwelcome thing as a
portion of our lives.</p>

<p class='c000'>Only the smallest fraction that we learned
in youth was assimilated and made a portion
of ourselves; the rest faded so completely
that it seemed never to have been. The
teacher soon became a dim, uncertain memory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>of the past, whose voice had long since
died away; but the skeleton in the closet
never wearied nor grew old. It ever made
us learn again the lesson we would fain forget;
opened at each succeeding period of
our lives the pages we would gladly put away,
until, at last, the ripening touch of time and
the specter’s constant presence made us
know. From the day it came beneath our
roof, it remained the liveliest, wisest, most
persistent member of the family group, the
tireless, watchful teacher, who would neither
sleep nor allow its pupil to forget.</p>

<p class='c000'>It may be that there are lives so barren
and uneventful that this guest passes ever
by their door, but unfortunate indeed is that
abode where it will not dwell. The wide
vistas can be seen only from the mountain
top, and the infinite depths of life can be
sounded only by the soul that has been
softened and hallowed by the sanctifying
touch of misery and sin.</p>

<p class='c000'>Life is a never-ending school, and the
really important lessons all tend to teach man
his proper relation to the environment where
he must live. With wild ambitions and desires
untamed, we are spawned out into a
shoreless sea of moving molecules of life,
each separate atom journeying on an unknown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>course, regardless of the countless
other lives it meets as it blindly rushes on;
no lights nor headlands stand to point the
proper way the voyager should take, he is
left to sail an untried bark across an angry
sea. If no disaster should befall, it does
not show that the traveler is wise or good,
but that his ambitions and desires are few
or he has kept close inside the harbor line.
At first we seek to swim the flood, to scale
the rocky heights, to clutch the twinkling
stars. Of course we fail and fall, and the
scars our passions and ambitions leave, remain,
though all our particles are made
anew year after year. We learn at last to
leave the stars to shine where they belong,
to take all things as they are and adjust our
lives to what must be.</p>

<p class='c000'>The philosophy of life can come only from
those experiences that leave lasting scars and
results that will not die. Rather than seek
to cover up these gaping wounds, we should
accept with grace the tales they tell, and
show them as trophies of the strife we have
passed through. Those scars are honorable
that have brought our lives into greater harmony
with the universal power. For resist
it as we will, this infinite, loving presence
will ever claim us as a portion of its self until
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>our smallest fragments return once more to
earth, and are united with the elements from
which we came.</p>

<p class='c000'>No life can be rounded and complete without
the education that the skeleton alone
can give. Until it came we never knew the
capacities of the human soul. We had learned
by rote to be forgiving, kind and true. But
the anguish of the human soul cannot be
told—it must be felt or never known. That
charity born of true comradeship, which is
the highest and holiest sentiment of life, can
be taught by the skeleton alone. The self-righteous,
who prate of forgiveness to their
fellow men and who look down upon their
sinning brothers from above, are hypocrites
or fools. They either have not lived or else
desire to pass for something they are not.
No one can understand the devious, miry
paths trodden by another soul unless he himself
has wandered through the night.</p>

<p class='c000'>Those placid, human lives that have
moved along a narrow, even path; that
learned by rote the lessons that the churches
and the schools have ever taught; whose perfection
consists in refraining from doing
certain things in certain ways; who never
had a noble thought or felt a great desire to
help their fellow men—those blameless, aimless,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>worthless souls, are neither good nor
bad. They neither feel nor think; no
skeleton would deem it worth its while to
come inside their door.</p>

<p class='c000'>The world judges the conduct of youth by
the standards of age. Even when due allowance
is made for the inexperience and
haste of the young, it is assumed that youth
and age are measured by the calendar alone.
Few have ever been wise enough to know
that every passion and circumstance must
be fully weighed, before an honest verdict
can be written down; and that therefore only
the infinite can judge a human soul.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though accursed, doubted, and despised,
Nature ever persists in her relentless plan.
She would make us learn the lessons that
youth so easily forgets. She finds us headstrong,
unreasoning, and moved by the same
feelings that sway the brute. She decrees
that every act, however blind or wilful,
must leave its consequences on our lives,
and these immortal consequences we treat
as skeletons and lock them up. But these
uncanny specters wrap us closely in their
bony arms; they ever peer with sightless
eyes into our soul; they are with us if we
sleep or wake, and their persistent presence
will not let us sleep. It is the hated, imprisoned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>skeleton that we vainly sought to
hide away, that takes an untamed, fiery soul
within its cruel, loving clasp, and holds it
closely in its unforgiving grasp until the vain
longings and wild desires of youth are subdued,
and cooled, and the deeper harmonies
of life are learned. It is the hated skeleton
that finds within our breast a heart of
flint and takes this hard and pulseless thing
and scars and twists and melts it in a
thousand tortuous ways until the stony mass
is purged and softened and is sensitive to
every touch.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is this same despised skeleton that finds
us vain and boastful and critical of others’
sins, that watches every word we speak and
even each unuttered thought; it is with us
when we tightly draw our robes and pass our
fellow on the other side; it hears us when
we seek to show how good we are by boasting
of our neighbor’s sins; for every spot of
black or red that we see upon another’s robes,
it points its bony fingers to a scar upon our
heart, to remind us that we are like the rest;
and the same finger ever points us to our
wounds until we feel and understand that
the clay the Master used for us was as weak
and poor as that from which he made the
rest.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>However blind and stubborn we may be,
however long we deny the lesson that the
skeleton would teach, still it will not let us
go until with perfect peace and harmony we
look at all the present and the past, at all
that was, and all that is, and feel no regrets
for what is gone, and no fears for what must
come. It may be that our stubborn, stiffnecked
soul will still persist until the hair is
white and the heavy shadows hang about our
heads, but the skeleton with his soothing,
softening ally, time, sits with the last watchers
at our suffering bed, and goes if need
be, to the silent grave, where alike the darkest
crimson spot and the softest, purest clay
are reunited once again with the loving, universal
mother who has forgiven all and conquered
all. It matters not how high we
seem to climb, or what the careless world
may think for good or ill. It matters not
how many small ambitions we may seem to
have achieved. Even the unworthy cannot
be forever soothed by the hollow voice of
fame. All triumphs are futile without the
victory over self; and when the triumph
over self is won, there are no more battles
to be fought, for all the world is then at
peace. It is the skeleton in the closet pointing
ever to the mistakes and maladjustments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>of our past, the skeleton standing there
before our gaze that makes us still remember
where our lives fell short; that teaches
us so slowly but so surely to turn from the
unworthy victories and the dire defeats of
life to the mastery of ourselves. It is the
skeleton from whom we learn that we can
live without the world, but not without
ourselves.</p>

<p class='c000'>Without the skeleton we could never feel
another’s sorrow, or know another’s pain.
Philosophy and theology cannot tell us how
another’s life became a hopeless wreck. It
is ourselves alone that reveals the precipice
along which every footpath leads. It is
from life we learn that it is but an accident
when we fall, and equally an accident when
we keep the path. The pupil of the schools
may look down with pitying glance upon
the unfortunate victim of what seems to be
his sin. He may point to a love that will
forgive and kindly plead with him to take
another path, but the wayfarer that the skeleton
has taught will clasp this fellow mortal
to his heart, for in his face he sees but the
reflection of himself. The wise and good
may forgive the evil and the wrong, but
only the sinner knows that there is no sin.</p>

<p class='c000'>The charity that is born of life and sin is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>not fine because of its effect on some one
else, but for what it does for us. True
charity is only the sense of the kinship of
all living things. This is the charity that
neither humiliates nor offends. It is the
sense that brings a new meaning to life and
a new purpose to the soul.</p>

<p class='c000'>Let us do simple justice to this neglected,
outcast guest, the useful, faithful teacher of
our lives. Let us open the closet door, and
let the skeleton come out, and lock the
schoolmaster in its place. Let us leave this
faithful friend to roam freely at its will. Let
us look it squarely in the face with neither
fear or shame, but with gratitude for the lessons
it has taught. It may be that the jeering
crowd will point in scorn as they see us with
the grewsome figure at our side, but when
we fully learn the lesson that it came to teach,
we shall need to look no more without for
the approval or disapproval of our acts, but
seek to satisfy ourselves alone. Let us place
a new chair beside the hearth, in the cosiest
nook, and bid the skeleton take its place as
the worthiest guest. Let us neither parade
nor hide our new-found friend, but treat it
as a fact of life—a fact that is, a fact that had
the right to be, and a fact that taught us how
to find ourselves. Let us not forget the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>parents, who watch us in our youth, and the
friends that were ever good and true. But
above all, let us remember this grim and
silent teacher, who never neglected or forgot,
who showed us life as only it could show,
who opened up new vistas to our soul, who
touched our human hearts, who made us
know and love our fellowman, who softened
and mellowed and purified our souls until
we felt the kinship that we bore to all living
things. Until it came we knew only the
surface of the world. Before it came, we
had tasted of the shallow cup of joy and the
bitter cup of pain, but we needed this to
teach us from the anguish of the soul that
there is a depth profound and great, where
pain and pleasure both are one. That there
is a life so deep and true that earth’s rewards
and penalties alike are but a hollow show;
that there is a conquest of ourselves, which
brings perfect peace and perfect rest.</p>

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
